ActiveTcl (http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/) is a distribution of [Tcl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Tcl) by ActiveState for many common platforms (and is considered to be the standard one on [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows)).
Includes both [tclsh](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/tclsh) and [wish](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/wish), as well as many extension packages (notably [tcllib](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/tcllib), [Critcl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Critcl), [SQLite](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:SQLite), [Snack](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Snack), [tDOM](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:TDOM), [Img](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:TkImg), which are used to solve some of the tasks on Rosetta Code).
