'''Borland C++''' is a [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:C) and [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:C++) programming environment for [MS-DOS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/DOS) and [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft) [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows). It was the successor to Turbo C++, and included a better debugger, the Turbo Debugger, which was written in protected mode DOS.
