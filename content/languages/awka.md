The AWKA translation utility converts AWK programs to ANSI C, and provides a separate library against which the C code is linked. The aims of AWKA are:

* to allow creation of executable files better performance than interpreted awk
* to allow easy inclusion of AWK logic in to larger C applications
* to provide access to external C functions within AWK scripts
