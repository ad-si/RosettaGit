[](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/runs_on_vm::java_virtual_machine)
'''Jacl''' is an implementation of [Tcl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Tcl) written in [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java) rather than the (more common) [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C) version shared by [tclsh](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/tclsh) and [wish](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/wish). The current version does not implement quite the same version of the language, does not include any support for [Tk](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Tk), and instead includes a package for closer Java integration (allowing the use of the [AWT](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/AWT), [Swing](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Swing), SWT, etc. for GUIs if desired).

<blockquote>''Consider using [JTcl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/JTcl) instead, which supports a larger fraction of the Tcl language and has more active developers working on it.''</blockquote>
