'''Windows Script Host''' (abbreviated '''WSH'''; originally '''Windows Scripting Host''') is the scripting engine included with modern releases of [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows). WSH was first included with [Windows 98](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98), but earlier versions of Windows could also get it by installing [Internet Explorer 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_5). <!-- not sure about Win16 --> WSH includes runtime engines for both [JScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/JScript) and [VBScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/VBScript).
