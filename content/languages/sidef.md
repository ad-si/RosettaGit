Sidef is a modern, dynamic, object-oriented programming language, focusing on simplicity, readability and elegance, taking the best from languages like [derived from::Ruby](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/derived_from::Ruby), [derived from::Go](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/derived_from::Go), [derived from::Perl 6](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/derived_from::Perl_6) and [derived from::Julia](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/derived_from::Julia).

The language is mostly used as a research programming language.
