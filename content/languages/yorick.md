Yorick is an interpreted programming language for scientific simulations or calculations, postprocessing or steering large simulation codes, interactive scientific graphics, and reading, writing, or translating large files of numbers. Yorick includes an interactive graphics package, and a binary file package capable of translating to and from the raw numeric formats of all modern computers. Yorick is written in [ANSI](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/ANSI) [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C) and runs on most operating systems (*nix systems, [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows), [Mac](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Mac)).

Yorick has a compact syntax, similar to C, but with array operators. It is easily expandable through dynamic linking of C libraries, allows efficient manipulation of arbitrary size/dimension arrays, and offers extensive graphic capabilities.

Yorick is similar in scope to languages like [IDL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/IDL) and [MATLAB](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/MATLAB).
