DWScript (DelphiWebScript) is a strongly-typed [object-oriented](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Object-oriented_language) scripting language based on the [Delphi](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Delphi) language, with extensions borrowed from other Object Pascal dialects. DWScript programming typically involves less code than classic Pascal due to the availability of type inference and inline declarations, though classic Object Pascal code is largely supported.
