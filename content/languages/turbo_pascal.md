'''Turbo Pascal''' is a software development system that includes a [compiler](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/compiler) and an [IDE](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/IDE) for [Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pascal) running on [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M), [CP/M-86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M-86), and [DOS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/DOS), developed in 1983 by [Borland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland) (one of the most well-known companies that developed for developers in the 1980's and early 90's) and now owned by [Embarcadero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Technologies). From version 6 on a more expensive version called '''Borland Pascal''' was also produced that included more libraries and standard library source code. (The name "Borland Pascal" is also used more generically for Borland's dialect of Pascal.)
