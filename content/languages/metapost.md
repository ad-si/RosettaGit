Metapost is a programming language derived from D.E.Knuth's [Metafont](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Metafont) language, but its output is [PostScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/PostScript) (hence the name) and therefore has extensions to the parent language, e.g. supports RGB colors; however, it has inherited some limitation of Metafont; the [Asymptote](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Asymptote) language is another language in the "family", but without those limitations.
