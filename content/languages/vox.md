The '''Vox''' programming language is multi-purpose language, designed to be used in embedded environments, as well as for general purposes.

Vox started out as a fork of the [Squirrel](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Squirrel) language, but has moved in a different direction ever since. While Squirrel is mostly intended to be used in embedding, Vox tries to tackle this problem by providing a larger standard library (based on [Boost](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Boost)), extended object manipulation (borrowing many ideas from languages like [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python)), and an <code>import</code> function, that is largely borrowed from [Lua](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lua) (only the idea, not the code). Despite that, Vox is ''not'' compatible with Squirrel.
