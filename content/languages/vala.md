'''Vala''' is a programming language created with the goal of bringing modern language features to [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C), with no added runtime requirements and with little overhead, by targeting the GObject object system. It is being developed by JÃ¼rg Billeter and Raffaele Sandrini. The syntax borrows heavily from [C#](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C#). Rather than being compiled directly to assembler or other intermediate representation, Vala is compiled to C source, which is then compiled with a platform's standard C compiler.

The '''valac''' compiler also supports a language dialect called [Genie](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Genie), that more closely resembles [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python) syntax.  '''Genie''' syntax requires indentation based code structure blocking.  The '''Genie''' dialect is also compiled to C on way to native executable by '''valac'''.
