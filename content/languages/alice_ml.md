Alice ML is a functional programming language based on [Standard ML](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Standard_ML), With ideas from [Oz](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Oz). It has rich support for concurrent, distributed, and constraint programming. Alice ML extends [Standard ML](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Standard_ML) with laziness, light-weight concurrency with implicit data-flow synchronisation, higher-order functors and abstract signatures, Packages, Pickling, type-safe cross-platform remote functions and network mobility & Constraints. It also has a lot of similarities to [Erlang](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Erlang).
