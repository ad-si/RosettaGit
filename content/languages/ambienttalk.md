AmbientTalk is a concurrent, distributed programming language designed specifically for mobile ad hoc networks. It's concurrency model is inspired by actors, and more specifically the event loop concurrency model of the [E](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/E) language. AmbientTalk has built-in support for distributed service discovery and (asynchronous) messaging.

The language was designed at the Software Languages Lab of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, primarily as a research framework for exploring new concurrent and distributed language features for highly dynamic, decentralized networks, such as wireless, mobile ad hoc networks.

The default implementation of AmbientTalk is a Java interpreter, which features full interoperability with the JVM, enabling AmbientTalk code to use existing Java libraries, and enabling Java code to use AmbientTalk as a distributed scripting language. Recent version of AmbientTalk also run on the Android OS, making AmbientTalk portable across a wide range of mobile phones.

## Trying AmbientTalk
