LFE, or Lisp Flavored Erlang, is a programming language which runs on the Erlang VM. Like Erlang itself, it has many features more commonly associated with an [operating system](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/OS) than with a programming language: concurrent [processes](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/process), scheduling, [memory management](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/garbage_collection), distribution, networking, etc. LFE provides developers the option of creating software that has the power of Erlang but with the syntax of a Lisp-2 language. Furthermore, LFE is 100% compatible/interoperable with Erlang Core.
