'''Aikido''' is an interpreted language that can be used for rapid scripting, prototyping and general programming tasks.

It was developed at [Sun Microsystems Laboratories](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) by David Allison and released as open source in September 2003, with the most recent release dated June 2007. It is a dynamically typed, object oriented language with built-in multithreading.

In some respects it is similar in functionality to [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python), [Perl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Perl), [JavaScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java). Syntactically it is very similar to [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C++) and Java.

Aikido is available for Linux, Mac OS X and Solaris.  The interpreter can be obtained from http://sourceforge.net/projects/aikido.  Documentation (in PDF) is at http://downloads.sourceforge.net/aikido/aikido_prm.pdf
