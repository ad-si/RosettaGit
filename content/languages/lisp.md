'''Lisp''' or '''LISP''' (originally an acronym for '''LIS'''t '''P'''rocessing) was one of the first high-level languages, invented in 1958 by John McCarthy. It had many descendants: major freestanding dialects still in use today are [Common Lisp](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Common_Lisp), [Scheme](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Scheme) & [Clojure](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Clojure). Other dialects of Lisp are used as scripting languages in applications, most notably [Emacs Lisp](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp), [AutoLISP](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/AutoLISP), and [Guile](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Guile).

(Today, the name is usually written "Lisp" rather than “LISP” among advocates, both because "we have lowercase letters now”, and to make a distinction between modern practical Lisp systems and the popular notion of “oh, LISP, that's where everything is a list or a symbol and you have to use recursion, right?”)

## How to categorize examples
This category is for solutions in archaic dialects or solutions valid in any dialect of Lisp. Please note the dialect used when adding examples.

If the solution is also valid in the dialects separately listed in Rosetta Code, such as Common Lisp and Scheme, then use the <nowiki></nowiki> template so that the task will be listed as solved for that dialect. For example:

 <nowiki>== (MacLisp, , )==</nowiki>
