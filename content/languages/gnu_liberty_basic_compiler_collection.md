The '''GNU Liberty Basic Compiler Collection''' ('''GLBCC''') is a suite of tools designed to allow [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows) and [Linux](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Linux) users to compile [Liberty BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Liberty_BASIC) code to a standalone application. Despite the name, GLBCC is not part of the [GNU](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GNU) project.

GLBCC hasn't been updated since 2002, and its compatibility with recent versions of Liberty BASIC is unknown.
