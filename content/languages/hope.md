'''Hope''' is a purely [functional programming](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/functional_programming) language from 1970s, which predates Miranda and [Haskell](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Haskell). It is the first language with call-by-pattern evaluation and algebraic data types, and its most used interpreter is fully [lazy evaluated](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/lazy_evaluation).
