'''OCaml''' (formerly known as Objective Caml) is the main implementation of the [Caml](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Caml) [programming language](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/programming_language), created by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme Vouillon, Damien Doligez, Didier Rémy and others in 1996.
OCaml is an [open source](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/open_source) project managed and principally maintained by INRIA.

OCaml extends the core [derived from::Caml](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/derived_from::Caml) language with [object-oriented](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/object-oriented_programming) constructs.

OCaml's toolset includes an interactive toplevel [interpreter](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/interpreter), a [bytecode](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/bytecode) [compiler](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/compiler), and an optimizing native code compiler.
It has a large standard library that makes it useful for many of the same applications as [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python) or [Perl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Perl), as well as robust modular and object-oriented programming constructs that make it applicable for large-scale software engineering.

OCaml is the successor to [Caml Light](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Caml_Light).
The acronym CAML originally stood for Categorical Abstract Machine Language, although OCaml abandons this abstract machine.
