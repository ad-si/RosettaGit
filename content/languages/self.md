'''Self''' is an [object-oriented](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/object-oriented) programming language based on the concept of prototypes. It was used primarily as an experimental test system for language design in the 1980s and 1990s; however, as of May 2015, Self is still being developed and maintained as an open source project. The latest major version is 2017.1, which was released in May 2017.
