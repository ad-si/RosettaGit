Unicon is a unification of several extended dialects of the [derived from::Icon](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/derived_from::Icon) language, featuring Icon plus classes, POSIX system facilities, GDBM and ODBC-based (SQL) database access, packages, 3D graphics and more, all provided at a very high semantic level.

In addition to Icon, Unicon draws from:
* IDOL an object-oriented Icon preprocessor
* MTIcon a multi-threading Icon. (Most recently, in version 12, improved multi-threading capabilities were added.)

While Unicon is mostly a super-set of Icon there are some differences and incompatibilities.

Icon itself is an evolution of the line of languages [COMIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMIT), SNOBOL, [SNOBOL4](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:SNOBOL4), and SL5.
