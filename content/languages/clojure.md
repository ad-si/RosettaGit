Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the [runs on vm::Java Virtual Machine](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/runs_on_vm::Java_Virtual_Machine).
It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming.
Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM [bytecode](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/bytecode), yet remains completely dynamic.
Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime.
Clojure provides easy access to the [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java) frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.

Clojure is a dialect of [Lisp](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lisp), and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system.
Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures.
When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.
