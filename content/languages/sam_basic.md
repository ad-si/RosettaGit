'''SAM BASIC''' was the ROM basic of Sam Coupé, a 8-bit home computer that was first released in 1989 by Miles Gordon Technology in the UK.

SAM BASIC was developed by BetaSoft and it was based on [Beta BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Beta_BASIC). However, it did not contain all of the Beta BASIC features.
Just like Beta BASIC was an extension to Sinclair BASIC, there was an extension to SAM BASIC, called Master BASIC.

SAM BASIC provided structural programming features such as DO LOOPs and multi line IF...ELSE blocks, and procedures with local variables, value and reference parameters and variable number of parameters with default values.
Graphics functions included software sprites, scalable and relocatable coordinate system, and BLIZ command which allows a string of graphics commands to be executed to quickly draw a shape at specified location and scaling.
