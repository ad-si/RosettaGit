'''Free Pascal Compiler''' ('''FPC''' for short) is a free and open-source [Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Pascal) and [Object Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Object_Pascal) compiler.

Free Pascal fully or partially supports the dialects of many other Pascal compilers, including those of [Turbo Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) (up to version 7), [Delphi](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Delphi), as well as some compilers that were available on the [Macintosh](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Macintosh). More than one dialect may be used to produce a single program. However, Free Pascal does not support the ISO Pascal standard.

A member of the [write once, compile anywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_compile_anywhere) campaign, Free Pascal is available on many architectures and operating systems. It has an excellent support for integration of [assembly language](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/assembly), and supports internal assembler in a number of dialects.

Separate projects exist to facilitate the development of cross-platform graphical applications, the most prominent one being the [Lazarus](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lazarus) IDE.
