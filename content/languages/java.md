The '''Java''' programming language, developed by [Sun Microsystems](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems), is a language aimed at allowing "high-performance", virtual application development.

Java source files (.java files) are typically [compiled](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Compiler) to an intermediate [bytecode](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/bytecode) (all platform) executable (.class files) and executed by a [Java Virtual Machine](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java_Virtual_Machine).
Most modern JVMs further compile the bytecode into your processor's native machine code during execution.
This native code translation is mostly done via a [JIT](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Just-In-Time) compiler that is built in the JVM. Some Java compilers (such as [GCJ](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GCJ)) can compile Java code to native machine code ahead-of-time rather than just-in-time.

The primary benefits of Java are:

* Cross-[platform](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/platform) (Write Once, Run Anywhere (if all of the libraries are ported))
* Comprehensive class library (which is thoroughly [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index.html documented])
* [Automatic memory management](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/garbage_collection)
* Large user community
* Well supported by the [open source](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/open_source) community and commercial industry ([Sun](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems), [IBM](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/IBM), [Oracle](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Oracle), HP, BEA, [Apple Inc](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Apple_Inc), etc.)

Java is used in a variety of environments including desktop applications, embedded device (PDA and wireless phone) applications, server-side web page serving applications (as [JSP](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java_Server_Pages)), and applets embedded in web pages.

There are a variety of arguments regarding Java's performance compared to other popular languages like [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C++). Some come to the conclusion that the programmer's choices make a bigger difference on performance in each language. Most show that each language is better than the other at specific types of operations (e.g. Java for memory allocation, C++ for numerical operations).
An extensive summary of comparisons between Java and C++ can be found [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Java_and_C++).

According to some [sources](http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm),
Java is currently one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
