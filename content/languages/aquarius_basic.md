'''Aquarius BASIC''' refers to the more or less stripped-down releases of Microsoft BASIC for the Mattel/Radofin Aquarius.  The built-in ROM BASIC was seriously restricted since the system only included 4K of RAM by default; the optionally available Extended Microsoft BASIC that came on ROM cartridge was somewhat more generous.
