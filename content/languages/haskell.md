Haskell is a standardized purely functional programming language
with non-strict semantics, named after the logician Haskell Curry.
It is one of the more popular functional languages,
and the lazy functional language on which the most research is being performed.

Although Haskell has a comparatively small user community,
its strengths have been well applied to a few projects:

- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) - Universal document converter.
- [Shellcheck]](https://www.shellcheck.net/) - Static analysis tool for shell scripts.
- [Pugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugs_(compiler)) by Audrey Tang - Implementation for the Perl 6 language
    with an interpreter and compilers that proved useful already after just a few months of its writing.
- [Darcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcs) - Revision control system with several innovative features.
