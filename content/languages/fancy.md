Fancy is a new (pure) [object-oriented](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/object-oriented) programming language that tries to meet the following goals:

* Be reasonably fast
* Be a dynamic language (as in [Smalltalk](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Smalltalk) or [Ruby](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Ruby))
* Be truly object oriented (as in Smalltalk or Ruby)
* Be concurrent (via the Actor Model)
* Be easy to understand
* Be portable and possibly run on multiple runtimes (this isn’t the case yet)

At the moment, Fancy follows most of the goals above. Its current implementation is an interpreter written in [implemented in language::C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/implemented_in_language::C++).
