Simula is considered the first object-oriented  programming language. As its name implies, Simula was designed for doing simulations, and the needs of that domain provided the framework for many of the features of object-oriented languages today.

Simula has been used in a wide range of applications such as simulating VLSI designs, process modeling, protocols, algorithms, and other applications such as typesetting, computer graphics, and education. Since Simula-type objects are reimplemented in [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C++), [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java) and [C#](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C#) the influence of Simula is often understated. The creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, has acknowledged that Simula 67 was the greatest influence on him to develop C++, to bring the kind of productivity enhancements offered by Simula to the raw computational speed offered by lower level languages like [BCPL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/BCPL).[[1](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/#Citation)]
