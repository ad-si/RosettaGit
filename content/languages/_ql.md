.QL (pronounced "dot-cue-el") is an object-oriented query language used to retrieve data from relational database management systems. It is reminiscent of the standard query language [SQL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/SQL) and the object-oriented programming language [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java). .QL is an object-oriented variant of a [logic programming](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/logic_programming) language known in the databases community as [Datalog](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Datalog). Hierarchical data can therefore be naturally queried in .QL in a recursive manner.
