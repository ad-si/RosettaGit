GNU Bash or simply Bash is a Unix shell and command language
written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement
for the Bourne shell.
First released in 1989, it has been used widely as the default login shell
for most Linux distributions and Apple's macOS Mojave and earlier versions.
A version is also available for Windows 10.
It is also the default user shell in Solaris 11

Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window
where the user types commands that cause actions.
Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script.
Like all Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching),
piping, here documents, command substitution, variables,
and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.
The keywords, syntax, dynamically scoped variables and other basic features
of the language are all copied from sh.
Other features, e.g., history, are copied from csh and ksh.
Bash is a POSIX-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions.

The shell's name is an acronym for Bourne-again shell,
a pun on the name of the Bourne shell that it replaces
and on the common term "born again".
