'''FALSE''' is a [Forth](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Forth)-like esoteric programming language invented by Wouter van Oortmerssen in 1993, originally written for the Amiga to see how small one could make a compiler (1K) for a language that was still powerful enough to write applications. FALSE directly inspired the creation of [Brainfuck](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Brainfuck) and [Befunge](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Befunge).
