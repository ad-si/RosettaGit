Maple is a symbolic and numeric computing environment, and is also a multi-paradigm programming language.

Developed by Maplesoft, Maple also covers other aspects of technical computing, including visualization, data analysis, matrix computation, and connectivity.

A toolbox, MapleSim, adds functionality for multidomain physical modeling and code generation.
