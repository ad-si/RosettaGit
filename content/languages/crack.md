Crack aims to provide the ease of development of a scripting language with the performance of a compiled language. The crack language itself derives concepts from [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C++), [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java) and [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python), incorporating [object-oriented programming](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/object-oriented_programming), operator overloading and strong typing.

The "crack" program is a "script executor" that compiles source to machine code [on the fly](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/JIT) (it will cache the code to intermediate formats as appropriate). A static (ahead of time) compiler is also in development.
