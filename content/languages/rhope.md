'''Rhope''' is a general purpose, multi-[paradigm](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Programming_Paradigms) language designed by Michael Pavone. It uses a combination of the dataflow paradigm and a transaction mechanism to make [concurrent programming](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/concurrent_programming) easier.
