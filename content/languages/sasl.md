SASL (from St Andrews Static Language, alternatively St Andrews Standard Language) is a purely functional programming language developed by David Turner at the University of St Andrews in 1972, based on the applicative subset of ISWIM.<br/> In 1976 Turner redesigned and reimplemented it as a non-strict (lazy) language. In this form it was the foundation of Turner's later languages KRC and Miranda, but SASL appears to be untyped whereas Miranda has polymorphic types.<br/>
