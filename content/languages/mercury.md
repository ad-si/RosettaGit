Mercury is a purely declarative functional logic programming language geared towards real-world applications. It is related to both [Prolog](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Prolog) and [Haskell](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Haskell). It features a strong, static, polymorphic type system, as well as a strong mode
and determinism system.

Mercury has several back-ends, Low-level [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C), High-level [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C), [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java), [Erlang](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Erlang), and [C#](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C_sharp).
