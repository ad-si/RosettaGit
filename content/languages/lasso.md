Lasso is an application server and server management interface used for developing internet applications as well as a general-purpose, high-level programming language. Born as a web datasource connection tool for Filemaker and later included in Apple Computer's FileMaker 4.0 and Claris Homepage as CDML, it has since evolved into a complex language used to develop and serve large-scale internet applications and web pages.
