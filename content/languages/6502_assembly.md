The MOS Technology 6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed by Chuck Peddle and Bill Mensch for MOS Technology in 1975. When it was introduced, it was the least expensive full-featured microprocessor on the market by a considerable margin, costing less than one-sixth the price of competing designs from larger companies such as Motorola and Intel. It was nevertheless fully comparable with them, and, along with the Zilog Z80, sparked a series of computer projects that would eventually result in the home computer revolution of the 1980s. The 6502 design, with about 4,000 transistors, was originally second-sourced by Rockwell and Synertek and later licensed to a number of companies. It is still made for embedded systems.

One of the first "public" uses for the design was the Apple I computer, introduced in 1976. The 6502 was next used in the Commodore PET and the Apple II. It was later used in the Atari home computers, the BBC Micro family, the Commodore VIC-20 and a large number of other designs both for home computers and business, such as Ohio Scientific and Oric.
