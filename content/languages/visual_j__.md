'''Visual J++''' is [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft)'s implementation of [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java). Microsoft's policy of ["embrace, extend and extinguish"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish) was applied during the creation of Visual J++, with the end result being a Java executable that might not run on the standard Sun Java runtime if certain MS features were used. (For more information, see [J++ compared to Sun's Java implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_J++#J++_compared_to_Sun's_Java_implementation) and [Sun's litigation against Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_J++#Sun's_litigation_against_Microsoft).)
