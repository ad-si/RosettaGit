### The <tt>ENVIRON</tt> and <tt>USING</tt> clauses.

These clauses are kind of the ''inverse'' of the '''#include''' found in the [C programming language](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C), or '''import''' found in [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python). The purpose of the <tt>ENVIRON</tt> mechanism is to allow a program source to be broken into manageable sized pieces. Note that it is only necessary to parse the shared source file once, unlike a '''#include''' found in the C programming language where the include file needs to be parsed for each source file that includes it.

### = Example of <tt>ENVIRON</tt> clause =

A file called ''mylib.a68'':

```txt

BEGIN
   INT dim = 3; # a constant #
   INT a number := 120; # a variable #
   ENVIRON EXAMPLE1;
   MODE MATRIX = [dim, dim]REAL; # a type definition #
   MATRIX m1;
   a number := ENVIRON EXAMPLE2;
   print((a number))
END

```


### = Example of <tt>USING</tt> clause =

A file called ''usemylib.a68'':

```txt

USING EXAMPLE2 FROM mylib
BEGIN
  MATRIX m2; # example only #
  print((a number)); # declared in mylib.a68 #
  print((2 UPB m1)); # also declared in mylib.a68 #
  ENVIRON EXAMPLE3;  # ENVIRONs can be nested #
  666
END

```


## Restrictions to the language from the standard '''ALGOL 68'''
* no algol68 FLEX and variable length arrays.
* <tt>MODE STRING</tt> implemented without FLEX.
* The PAR parallel clause was not implemented.
* nonstandard transput. 
* others...

A translator/compiler for ALGOL 68C was available for the PDP-10 and System/360 as well as a number of other computers.
