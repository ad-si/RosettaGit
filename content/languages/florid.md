FLORID (F-LOgic Reasoning In Databases) is a deductive object-oriented database system employing [F-Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLogic) as data definition and query language. With the increasing interest in semistructured data, Florid has been extended for handling semistructured data in the context of Information Integration from the Semantic Web.
