[Digital Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Mars) C++ is a free [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:C++) compiler for [DOS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/DOS) and [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows).

Originally a [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:C) compiler created by [Datalight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalight), it was sold to [Zortech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zortech), who then added a C++ compiler, calling the result '''Zortech C++'''. [Symantec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symantec) purchased Zortech specifically to get ownership of these compilers, which were eventually acquired by Digital Mars (which is more well-known for creating the [D programming language](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:D)).
