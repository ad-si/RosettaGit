 is the name used to refer to the default set of ''macros'' which are always present on all [](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/TeX) systems
(and it is the default preloaded format for <tt>tex</tt> executable). They were written by Knuth himself, and provide the basic to start using [](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/TeX) (since "raw" [](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/TeX) is not ready-to-use for documents creation). Often when one says simply " document", s/he means s/he is using the  macros, even though nowadays the success of the complex feature-full [](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/LaTeX) macros package creates a little bit of confusion and a lot of people, ignoring that  is just one of possible macro packages for , think that  is  and viceversa.

Extension to the  exists, like eplain().

Even though [](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/LaTeX) is nowadays almost a typesetting "standard" when using a [](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/TeX) system,  is still usable and used.
