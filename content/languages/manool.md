MANOOL is a homoiconic, dynamic, and multi-paradigm general-purpose computer programming language with a functional core. The author's implementation of MANOOL is made for native-code run-time environments, is written in idiomatic C‚Å†++11 (with GCC-specific extensions), and currently runs under several Unix-like operating systems (OSes) on a number of CPU instruction-set architectures (ISAs). The implementation is a free and open-source (FOSS) software development tool published under the version 3 of the GNU General Public License (GPLv3).
