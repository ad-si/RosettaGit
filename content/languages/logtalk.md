Logtalk is an object-oriented logic programming language that extends and leverages the [Prolog](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Prolog) language with a feature set suitable for programming in the large. As a multi-paradigm language, it includes support for encapsulation and data hiding, separation of concerns and enhanced code reuse, both prototypes and classes, protocols (interfaces), component-based programming through category-based composition, event-driven programming, and high-level multi-threading programming. Logtalk uses standard Prolog syntax with the addition of a few operators and directives.
