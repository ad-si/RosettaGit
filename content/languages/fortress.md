Fortress is a new programming language designed for high-performance computing (HPC) with high programmability. The name "Fortress" is intended to connote a secure Fortran, i.e., "a language for high-performance computation that provides abstraction and type safety on par with modern programming language principles."[[1](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/#Citation)] Fortress is designed to be both highly parallel and have rich functionality contained within libraries, drawing from Java but taken to a higher degree.
