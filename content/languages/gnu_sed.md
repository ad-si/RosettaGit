[wp:sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sed) (stream editor) is a non-interactive text editor. 
It is used to filter text, i.e., it takes text input, 
performs some operation (or set of operations) on it, 
and outputs the modified text. 

sed is typically used for extracting part of a file using pattern matching 
or substituting multiple occurrences of a string within a file.
