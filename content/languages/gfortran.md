'''gfortran''' is the name of the GNU Fortran compiler, which is part of the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection). gfortran has replaced the g77 compiler, which stopped development before GCC version 4.0. It includes support for the [Fortran 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran#Fortran_95) language and is compatible with most language extensions supported by g77, allowing it to serve as a drop-in replacement in many cases. Parts of [Fortran 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran#Fortran_2003) and [Fortran 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran#Fortran_2008) have also been implemented.
