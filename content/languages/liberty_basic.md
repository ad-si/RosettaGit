Liberty BASIC is a procedural programming language for [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows) PCs, created by Shoptalk Systems. It was intended as a simple way to create professional programs, with full [GUI](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GUI) ability, while still keeping a very simple [BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/BASIC) syntax.  While the current version only supports Windows, the next major release will support [Mac OS X](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X) and [Linux](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Linux) as well. Liberty BASIC runs under Wine on Linux at present.
