TCC — Tiny C Compiler — is a compiler of [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C) designed to be used in embedded environments. It only generates code for the x86 and x86-64 architectures.

There is a [Tcl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Tcl) extension that embeds TCC to enable putting C inside Tcl scripts. (See [http://wiki.tcl.tk/20123 the Tcler's Wiki] for more details.)
