A compliant implementation of the [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python) language written in a restricted subset of [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python) which can be run in another [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python) interpreter or translated to C and compiled for fast execution.

PyPy's Mission Statement is to provide:
* a common translation and support framework for producing implementations of dynamic languages, emphasising a clean separation between language specification and implementation aspects.
* a compliant, flexible and fast implementation of the Python Language using the above framework to enable new advanced features without having to encode low level details into it.<ref>http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/architecture.html#mission-statement</ref>
