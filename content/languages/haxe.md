'''[https://haxe.org/ Haxe]''' is a general-purpose high-level modern OO programming language with a familiar C-/JS-like syntax. It can compile to numerous targets, including [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C++), [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python), [JavaScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/JavaScript), [Lua](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lua), [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java), [PHP](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/PHP), [C sharp](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C_sharp), ActionScript3,  Adobe Flash, as well as to bytecode for its very own HashLink VM and Neko VM, and the JVM. The compiler also comes with its own built-in interpreter.

With Haxe you can compile a single codebase to multiple targets depending upon your [https://haxe.org/use-cases/ use-case].

Haxe is a mature language with a very fast compiler. See its [https://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/language-introduction.html Language Intro] for a quick overview of the language.
