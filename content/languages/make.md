'''Make''' is one of the mini-languages of [UNIX](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/UNIX).

It is Turing complete if recursive invocation is allowed.

[Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) is normally used to automate
the process of building software-projects,

i.e. the steps to compile, link, etc.
