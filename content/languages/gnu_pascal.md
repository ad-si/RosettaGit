GNU Pascal is an implementation of Pascal for the GCC. While it uses the GCC back end, it isn't integrated into the FSF GCC distribution, but has to be obtained separately. It supports both Standard Pascal (ISO 7185) and Extended Standard Pascal (ISO 10206), as well as [Borland Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Borland_Pascal). It also has partial support for other Pascal dialects and also provides several GNU Pascal specific extensions.
