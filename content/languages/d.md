'''D''' is an [object-oriented](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/object-oriented), [imperative](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/imperative_programming), multi-[paradigm](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Programming_Paradigms) systems programming language designed by Walter Bright of Digital Mars.
Although it originated as a re-engineering of [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C++), and is thus predominantly influenced by that language, it is not a variant of C++.
Rather, D redesigns some C++ features and is influenced by concepts from other programming languages such as [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python), [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java), [C#](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C_sharp) and [Eiffel](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Eiffel).
