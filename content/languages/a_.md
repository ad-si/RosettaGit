A+ is an array programming language, which is derived from the programming language [derived from::A](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/derived_from::A), a dialect of [APL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/APL) with aggressive extensions. Arthur Whitney developed the "A" portion of A+, while other developers at Morgan Stanley extended it, adding a graphical user interface and other language features. A+ was designed for numerically intensive applications, especially those found in financial applications. A+ runs on many Unix variants, including Linux. A+ is a high-level, interactive, interpreted language.[[1](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/#Citation)]
