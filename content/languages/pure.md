From the official [http://puredocs.bitbucket.org/pure.html Pure manual]: "Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term rewriting. Pure programs are basically collections of equational rules used to evaluate expressions in a symbolic fashion by reducing them to normal form."

The Pure interpreter uses LLVM to JIT-compile code; in addition, Pure programs can be compiled with LLVM to machine code as well.
