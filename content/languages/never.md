'''Never''' is a simple functional programming language. Technically it may be classified as syntactically scoped, strongly typed, call by value, functional programming language.

In practise Never offers basic data types, assignment, control flow, arrays,
first order functions and some mathematical functions to make it useful
to calculate expressions. Also it demonstrates how functions can be compiled,
invoked and passed as parameters or results between other functions.

Developed by Slawomir Maludzinski, '''Never''' is an embeddable language, and can be used from environments that support the C Application Binary Interface and dynamic symbol lookup.
