Ruby is an interpreted language written by Yukihiro "matz" Matsumoto that originates from Japan.

It is a language that combines
* Joy of programming
* Powerful [object-oriented](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/object-oriented) style
* Flexibility and extensibility
* [Platform](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Platform) independence

Ruby is a language of careful balance.
Its creator blended parts of his favorite languages ([Perl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Perl), [Smalltalk](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Smalltalk), [Eiffel](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Eiffel), [Ada](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Ada), and [Lisp](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lisp)) to form a new language that balances [functional programming](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/functional_programming) with [imperative programming](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/imperative_programming).

He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a way that mirrors life.

Since its public release in 1995, Ruby has drawn devoted coders worldwide.
In 2006, Ruby achieved mass acceptance.
The [http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm TIOBE] index, which measures the growth of programming languages, ranks Ruby as #11 among programming languages worldwide.
Much of the growth is attributed to the popularity of software written in Ruby, particularly the Rails web framework.

An interactive tutorial is available in the form of an [http://tryruby.org/ Interactive Console] inside of your Web Browser.
