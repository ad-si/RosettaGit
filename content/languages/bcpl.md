BCPL is a typeless ancestor of [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C).

BCPL was first implemented at MIT by Martin Richards early in 1967. It was strongly influenced by CPL which was a general purpose language developed jointly at Cambridge and London Universities between 1962 and 1966.

BCPL is a very simple typeless language in which all values are of the same size, typically a 32-bit word. It
has a compiler freely available via http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mr10. This web page also contains several link to other items including Cintpos an interpretive implementation of the Tripos Portable Operating System and a manual covering both BCPL and Cintpos.

BCPL and Cintpos are still undergoing slow development.
