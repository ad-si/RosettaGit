'''PowerBASIC Console Compiler''' (a.k.a. '''PB/CC''') is the [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows) [console (text-mode)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) compiler for [PowerBASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/PowerBASIC). It somewhat resembles [PowerBASIC for DOS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/PowerBASIC_for_DOS), but instead of console graphics routines, it includes simple window-handling and drawing routines.

While there are some minor differences between PB/CC and [PowerBASIC for Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/PowerBASIC_for_Windows), for the most part they use the same language.
