'''Active Server Pages''', usually abbreviated as '''ASP''', is a scripting engine for web servers. Although developed by [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft), and used almost exclusively under [IIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services), there are a few third-party implementations, most notably [http://www.apache-asp.org/ Apache::ASP] (and, before the Oracle buyout, Sun's Chilisoft ASP).

By default, the Microsoft implementation of ASP includes [VBScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:VBScript) and [JavaScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:JavaScript), but can be extended to use other languages, such as [PerlScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PerlScript) (derived from [Perl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Perl)).
