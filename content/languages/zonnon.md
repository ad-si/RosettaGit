Zonnon is a general-purpose programming language in the [Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pascal), [Modula-2](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Modula-2) and [Oberon](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Oberon) family. It retains an emphasis on simplicity, clear syntax and separation of concerns whilst focusing on concurrency and ease of composition and expression. Unification of abstractions is at the heart of its design and this is reflected in its conceptual model based on modules, objects, definitions and implementations. Zonnon offers a new computing model based on active objects with their interaction defined by syntax controlled dialogs. It also introduces new features including operator overloading and exception handling, and is specifically designed to be platform independent.
