Axe is a compiled programming language for the TI-83 and TI-84 series calculators.
It has a syntax similar to (but far more powerful than) [[TI-83 BASIC]],
but it compiles to a no-stub [[Z80 Assembly]] executable
rather than being interpreted like BASIC.
Many of the language features are designed to ease writing games,
but it can be used to write any kind of program.

Its initial release was in 2010 and has been in constant development since then.
It quickly became a favorite among TI-83/84 developers
due to its speed of development and high performance.
