In computer science, Coq is a proof assistant application. It allows the expression of mathematical assertions, mechanically checks proofs of these assertions, helps to find formal proofs, and extracts a certified program from the constructive proof of its formal specification. Coq works within the theory of the calculus of inductive constructions, a derivative of the calculus of constructions. Coq is not an automated [theorem prover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem_prover) but includes automatic theorem proving tactics and various decision procedures.
