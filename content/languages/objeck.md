'''Objeck ''' is an [object-oriented](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/object-oriented) computing language with [functional](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/functional_programming) features. The language has ties with [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java) and [Scheme](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Scheme). In this language all data types are treated as objects and functions are first-class.

The programming environment consists of an optimizing compiler, command-line debugger and virtual machine with associated [garbage collector](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Garbage_collection) and [JIT](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/JIT) compiler. The compiler emits binary [bytecode](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/bytecode) that is executed by the runtime system. The runtime system has the ability to translate the bytecode into AMD64 or IA-32 machine code on the fly.
