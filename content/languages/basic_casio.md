'''Basic Casio''' is the high-level language used on Casio calculators. It is available on all Casio calculators despite some differences between versions. Basic Casio is designed to be simple and easy to learn for students. Its major drawback is its slowness especially when using graphical functions. Basic Casio is not affiliated with [BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/BASIC) and is not as similar to it as the name would suggest. Basic Casio is equivalent to [TI-BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/TI-BASIC) on TI calculators.
