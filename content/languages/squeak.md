'''Squeak''' was derived directly from [Smalltalk-80](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Smalltalk) by a group at [Apple Computer](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Apple_Inc) that included some of the original Smalltalk-80 developers. Its development was continued by the same group at [Walt Disney Imagineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Imagineering), where it was intended for use in internal Disney projects.

Squeak is available for many platforms, and programs produced on one platform run bit-identical on all other platforms. The Squeak system includes code for generating a new version of the virtual machine (VM) on which it runs. It also includes a VM simulator written in itself (Squeak). For this reason, it is easily ported.
