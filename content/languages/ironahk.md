IronAHK is a port of AutoHotkey functionality to .NET and Mono in order to gain cross-platform functionality on Unix and Macintosh systems. This version's implementation has the goal of implementing most of the functionality from [AutoHotkey_Basic](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/AutoHotkey_Basic), in addition to JSON structures.
