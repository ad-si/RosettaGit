<blockquote>
Clozure CL is a free Common Lisp implementation [...] Some distinguishing features of the implementation include:
*fast compilation speed
*native OS threads
*precise, generational, compacting garbage collector
*convenient foreign-function interface
Clozure CL used to be called OpenMCL. It is also sometimes called CCL. You will see the three names being used interchangeably.</blockquote>
