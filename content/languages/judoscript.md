'''JudoScript''' is a scripting language based atop of [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java).

From the website:

:''Judo is a practical, functional scripting language. It is designed to cover the use cases of not only algorithmic/object-oriented/multi-threaded programming and Java scripting but also a number of major application domain tasks, such as scripting for JDBC, WSDL, ActiveX, OS, multiple file/data formats, etc. Despite its rich functionality, the base language is extremely simple, and domain support syntax is totally intuitive to domain experts, so that even though you have never programmed in Judo, you would have little trouble figuring out what the code does.''
