ooRexx (aka Open Object Rexx) is an object oriented successor of 'Classic' Rexx
(another one is NetRexx). Both Open Object Rexx and NetRexx were created by IBM and are now,
open sourced, maintained by the [http://www.rexxla.org/ Rexx Language Association].

ooRexx can be used to run many programs shown here in the [REXX](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/REXX) category.

See http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code:Village_Pump/Dialects#REXX.2C_ooRexx.2C_and_others
for differences.
