FreeMat is a free environment for rapid engineering and scientific prototyping and data processing. It is similar to commercial systems such as [MATLAB](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/MATLAB) from Mathworks, and [IDL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/IDL) from Research Systems, but is Open Source. FreeMat is available under the GPL license.
