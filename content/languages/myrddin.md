Myrddin is a programming language. It aims for control and simplicity. It features strong type checking, generics, type inference, closures, and traits. It aims to fit into a similar niche as C, but with fewer bullets in your feet.

Myrddin does not aim to explore the forefront of type theory or compiler technology. It does not focus on guaranteeing perfect safety. It is satisfied to be a practical, small language.
