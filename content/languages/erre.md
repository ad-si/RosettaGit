ERRE was born as a university project (Politecnico di Milano - Italy) in the 80's on a C-64 computer.
The language was ported to IBM PC and revised various times.

The actual versions are:

* '''V 2.6''' on PC IBM and compatibles (from MS-DOS 5.0 to Win XP)

* '''V 3.2''' on C-64

There also a reduced version for VIC-20 ('''V 1.3''') and a more recent version for PC ('''V 3.0''') with limited OOP support.
