An implementation of [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python) for the [runs on vm::Java Virtual Machine](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/runs_on_vm::Java_Virtual_Machine).

Jython is the successor to JPython. The Jython project was created in accordance with the CNRI JPython 1.1.x license, in order to ensure the continued existence and development of this important piece of Python software. The intent is to manage this project with the same open policies that are serving [CPython](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/CPython) so well.<ref>http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonFaq/GeneralInfo#WhatisJython.3F</ref>

JPython is an implementation of the Python programming language which is designed to run on the Java(tm) Platform. It consists of a compiler to compile Python source code down to Java bytecodes which can run directly on a JVM, a set of support libraries which are used by the compiled Java bytecodes, and extra support to make it trivial to use Java packages from within JPython. JPython has been renamed and superseded by Jython. <ref>http://wiki.python.org/jython/JythonFaq/GeneralInfo#WhatisJPython.3F</ref>
