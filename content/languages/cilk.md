'''Cilk''' (pronounced ''silk'') is a general-purpose programming language designed for multithreaded [parallel computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parallel_computing).

The Cilk language has been developed since 1994 at the [MIT Laboratory for Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology). It is based on [ANSI C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:C), with the addition of a handful of Cilk-specific keywords. When the Cilk keywords are removed from Cilk source code, the result is a valid C program, called the ''serial elision'' (or ''C elision'') of the full Cilk program. Cilk is a faithful extension of C and the serial elision of any Cilk program is always a valid serial implementation in C of the semantics of the parallel Cilk program.
