Critical Mass Modula-3 is an open source implementation of [Modula-3](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Modula-3) originally created by Critical Mass.

CM3 is the 'main' Modula-3 implementation currently.

There is very little [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C) code in the implementation, even in the runtime.

Recently (About the middle of 2009) CM3 has seen a surge in development, and a stable release is planned. Version 5.8 RC3 is available, with a stable release in the next few months.
