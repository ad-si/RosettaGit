'''Gastona''' is an interpreted language which main goal is to build applications with or
without Graphical User Interface with the less programming effort possible. Although it has variables, loops,
conditionals and other programming language characteristics, it can be considered more close to be
a "smart" configuration system.

Current implementations are based on java and the code is open source that can be found at
[https://github.com/wakeupthecat/gastona github.com/wakeupthecat/gastoAna]. Binaries for Windows, Linux and also Android can be found at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/gastona/ sourceforge.net/projects/gastona].
