'''The ALGOL 68S System''' written by [C.H. Lindsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Lindsey) using the [Amsterdam Compiler Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_Compiler_Kit).  Current version is v2.4.

The system runs on the following systems.
* sun3 under OS4.x - v2.3
* sparc under OS4.x - v2.4
* sparc under OS5.x (Solaris 2.x) v2.4
* Atari under Gemdos - v2.3
* Acorn Archimedes under Riscos v2.4

The ALGOL 68 program gets the extension ".8", eg to compile type:
        a68s -c.e progname.8

The original system was developed for a [CDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_6000_series) computer, then ported to [PERQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PERQ)s running [PNX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNX).  This also means that there are other [ALGOL 68S](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/ALGOL_68S) compilers descended from the same stock.
