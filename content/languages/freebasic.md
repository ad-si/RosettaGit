'''FreeBASIC''' is a free/[open source](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/open_source) ([GPL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GPL)), 32-bit [BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/BASIC) compiler for [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft) [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows), protected-mode [DOS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/DOS) (via a [DOS extender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_extender)), and [Linux](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Linux), with unofficial ports to [Mac OS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Mac_OS) and [FreeBSD](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/BSD). An experimental [Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox) version is no longer maintained.


FreeBASIC makes use of the [GNU Binutils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Binutils) programming tools as backends, and can produce console, [QuickBASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/QuickBASIC)-compatible graphical and [GUI](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GUI) executables, along with dynamic and static libraries. A [GCC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GCC) frontend is under development, which will enable compilation for many more operating systems than currently supported.

Currently, software libraries like [GTK+](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GTK+), [GSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Scientific_Library), [SDL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:SDL), [Allegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegro_library), [Lua](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lua) and [OpenGL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/OpenGL) can be used directly (no wrappers, only function and structure prototypes), and more are being added on every new release. A complete set of the Windows [API](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/API) headers is also included.

The compiler, and its nearly 90,000 lines of code, was, and still is, compiled by itself (in other words, FreeBASIC is a [self-hosting compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting)). The first version of FreeBASIC was written in [Visual Basic](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Visual_Basic) for DOS for that purpose.
