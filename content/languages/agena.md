## What is Agena ?
Agena is an easy-to-learn procedural programming language designed to be used in scientific, educational, linguistic, and many other applications.

## What can you do with Agena ?
Agena provides all the means to implement ideas quickly: fast real and complex arithmetics, efficient text processing, graphics, flexible data structures, intelligent procedures, simple package management, plus various configuration facilities in multi-user environments.

Besides providing basic operations, it has advanced programming features such as high-speed processing of data structures,
extended conditionals, abridged and extended syntax for loops, efficient recursion techniques, an arbitrary precision mathematical library, easy-to-use package handling, and much more.

## Which operating systems are supported ?
Installers are available for [Solaris](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Solaris), [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows), [Linux](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Linux), [Mac OS X](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X), [OS/2](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/OS/2) & eComStation, and DOS.

## How does it look like ?
The syntax looks like very simplified [ALGOL 68](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/ALGOL_68) with elements taken from [Lua](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lua) and [SQL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/SQL).

## How has it been implemented ?
Agena is based on the [ANSI](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/ANSI) [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C) source code of [Lua](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lua), a popular and widely used Open Source programming language.
