'''Cilk++''' is a commercial implementation of [Cilk](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Cilk) that was developed by Cilk Arts, Inc. Like MIT Cilk, it supports [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:C); unlike MIT Cilk, it also supports [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:C++). It is compatible with both [GCC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection) and [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft) C++ compilers. In addition to the commercial verison, Academic and Open Source versions also exist, where the Open Source version is under an in-house license that falls somewhere between the updated BSD license and the LGPL.

In 2009, [Intel](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Intel) acquired Cilk Arts, the Cilk++ technology and the Cilk trademark. In 2010, Intel released a commercial implementation in its compilers combined with some data parallel constructs with the name [Intel Cilk Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Cilk_Plus). Intel has also released a specification to enable other compatible implementations, and has said the trademark will be usable by compliant implementations.
