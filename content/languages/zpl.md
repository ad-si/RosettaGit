ZPL is an array programming language (like [APL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/APL), [J](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/J), and [Glee](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Glee)) designed from first principles for fast execution on both sequential and parallel computers. It provides a convenient high-level programming medium for supercomputers and large-scale clusters with efficiency comparable to hand-coded message passing. It is the perfect alternative to using a sequential language like C or Fortran and a message passing library like MPI. It is based around a matrix, and it compiles to [ANSI](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/ANSI) [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C).
