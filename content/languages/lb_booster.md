'''LB Booster''' ('''LBB''') is a free alternative compiler for [Liberty BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Liberty_BASIC) by [Richard T. Russell](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/User:RichardRussell), the author of [BBC BASIC for Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC_for_Windows) (BB4W).

LBB is actually a variation of BB4W, and has similar capabilities and limitations. The LBB page claims that it can:
*Speed up a Liberty BASIC program by up to ten times. 
*Compile a Liberty BASIC program to a compact, standalone executable. 
*Overcome many of Liberty BASIC's bugs and limitations.
