[Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(Apple_programming_language)) is a general purpose, multi-paradigm, systems programming language developed by Apple Inc. originally for Apple platforms. Linux support was added when open source Swift was released. It runs on the Objective-C runtime on Darwin and is mainly used with the Cocoa API. It was announced at WWDC 2014.
