'''Component Pascal''' is a programming language in the tradition of Oberon and [Oberon-2](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Oberon-2), the last language Niklaus Wirth designed before he retired in 1999. It bears the name of the [Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pascal) programming language but is incompatible with it. Instead, it is a minor variant and refinement of Oberon-2, designed and supported by a small ETH ZÃ¼rich spin-off company called Oberon microsystems. Their [IDE](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/IDE) is called BlackBox Component Builder. At the time the first version was released (1994) it presented a novel approach to graphical user interface ([GUI](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GUI)) construction based on editable forms, where fields and command buttons are linked to exported variables and executable procedures. This approach bears some similarity to the code-behind way used in [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft)'s [.NET](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/.NET) 3.0 to access code in XAML.
