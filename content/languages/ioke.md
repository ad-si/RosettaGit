Ioke is a folding language. It allows you to write highly expressive code that writes code. Ioke allows you to create abstractions at any level, and expressiveness is the ultimate goal of the language.

Ioke is a dynamic language targeted at virtual machines, currently the [Java Virtual Machine](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java_Virtual_Machine) and the [Common Language Runtime](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime). It's been designed from scratch to be a highly flexible general purpose language. It is a prototype-based programming language that is inspired by [Io](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Io), [Smalltalk](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Smalltalk), [Lisp](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lisp) and [Ruby](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Ruby).
