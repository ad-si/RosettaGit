Toka is a concatenative programming language with similarities to [Forth](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Forth). It has two accessible [stacks](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Stack) for passing data, a dictionary which maps names to functions, an [interpreter](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/interpreter), a [compiler](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/compiler) (generating threaded code), a form of [garbage collection](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/garbage_collection), and various functions to aid in debugging and inspecting compiled code. Toka also has a set of optional libraries that extend the core language in many ways.

Toka is distributed under an [open-source](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/open_source) license.
