Berp is an implementation of Python 3. At its heart is a translator, which takes [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python) code as input and generates [Haskell](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Haskell) code as output. The Haskell code is fed into a Haskell compiler ([GHC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GHC)) for compilation to machine code or interpretation as byte code.

Berp provides both a compiler and an interactive interpreter. For the most part it can be used in the same way as [CPython](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/CPython) (the main Python implementation).
