VBScript is a programming language from [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft) for [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows) and [Active Server Pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages) (and web page scripting on the Internet, to a much lesser degree). VBScript is similar to [Visual Basic](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Visual_Basic), and was originally based on VB, but there are many differences between the two. In general, VBScript is not able to run most non-trivial VB programs without significant changes, while ''most'' VBScript programs can be run in VB with trivial changes.
