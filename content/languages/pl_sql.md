'''PL/SQL''' (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is Oracle Corporation's proprietary server-based procedural extension to the [SQL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/SQL) database language. (Some other SQL database management systems offer languages similar to PL/SQL.) Its syntax strongly resembles that of [Ada](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Ada).

IBM [Db2 LUW](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/SQL_PL) (for Linux, UNIX and Windows) from version 9.7 supports natively Oracle's PL/SQL. That means, you can create stored procedures in Db2 with PL/SQL language.
