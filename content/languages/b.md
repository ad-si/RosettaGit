B is a computer language intended for recursive, primarily non-numeric applications typified by system programming. B has a small, unrestrictive syntax that is easy to compile. Because of the unusual freedom of expression and a rich set of operators, B programs are often quite compact.

B takes many features from [derived from::BCPL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/derived_from::BCPL). B is the ancestor of [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C).
