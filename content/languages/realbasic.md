'''REALbasic''' (or '''RB''') is a [BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/BASIC) compiler for [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows), [Mac OS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Mac_OS), and [Linux](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Linux), made by [http://www.xojo.com/ Xojo, Inc.] It has its own [IDE](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/IDE), and projects are saved to a proprietary binary format. Unlike most BASICs, REALbasic is heavily object-oriented.

As of June 2013, the language, IDE, and company have been re-branded as [Xojo](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Xojo).

REALbasic is not compatible with other BASICs, for the most part; examples from other BASICs usually have to be completely rewritten to work in RB.

[The Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REALbasic) has lots of information about REALbasic's history, capabilities, and features.
