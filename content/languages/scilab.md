[http://www.scilab.org/ Scilab] is a free and open source, cross-platform numerical computational package and a high-level, numerically oriented programming language. It can be used for signal processing, statistical analysis, image enhancement, fluid dynamics simulations, numerical optimization, and modeling and simulation of explicit and implicit dynamical systems. [MATLAB](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/MATLAB) code, which is similar in syntax, can be converted to Scilab. Scilab is one of several open source alternatives to MATLAB.
