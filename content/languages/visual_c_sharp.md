'''Microsoft Visual C#''' is [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft)'s implementation of the [C#](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:C_sharp) specification, included in the [Visual Studio](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Visual_Studio) suite of products. It is based on the [ECMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International)/[ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization) specification of the C# language, which Microsoft also created. While multiple implementations of the specification exist, Visual C# is by far the one most commonly used. In most contexts, an unqualified reference to "C#" is taken to mean "Visual C#."

Visual C# is currently used in development of [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows) and [Xbox Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live) games via [Microsoft XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA), which allows game developers to create and share their games with other gamers.
