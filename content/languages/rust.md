Rust is a general purpose, multi-paradigm, systems programming language sponsored by Mozilla. Its goal is to provide a fast, practical, concurrent language with zero-cost abstractions and strong memory safety. It employs a unique model of ownership to eliminate data races.

Solutions to RosettaCode tasks are mirrored on GitHub at [http://github.com/Hoverbear/rust-rosetta Hoverbear/rust-rosetta]. If you implement a solution here, please open a pull request!

## Features
From the official website:
* zero-cost abstractions
* move semantics
* guaranteed memory safety
* threads without data races
* trait-based generics
* pattern matching
* type inference
* minimal runtime
* efficient C bindings
