'''Visual Basic''' is a language developed by [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft) to advance [BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/BASIC) into the realm of [GUI](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GUI) programming. While Microsoft ceased development of the language at version 6, a new language called [Visual Basic .NET](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Visual_Basic_.NET) was developed around the [.Net Framework](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/.Net_Framework).

Used by Microsoft's flagship product Office, the embedded version of Visual Basic continues to be maintained. This version is known as [Visual Basic for Applications](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:VBA) and uses the same syntax as, and is mostly compatible with, Visual Basic 6.

## Categorization
Visual Basic can be divided into a few broad categories: VBDOS, Classic VB, and VB .Net.
*'''Visual Basic for DOS''' (or '''VBDOS''') is really part of the [QuickBASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/QuickBASIC) family -- in fact, VBDOS can compile most QB programs without change, and could be considered the "missing link" between QB and "real" VB. See [this section of WP's VB page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic#Timeline) for a tiny bit of info. (There is a Win16 program included with VBDOS that can translate VBDOS code to VB1 code, and vice-versa. The "forms" part of VBDOS is very similar to VB1; it's ''everything else'' that needed translating.)
*'''Classic VB''' combines VB for 16-bit Windows, and pre-.Net VB for 32-bit Windows:
**'''"Early" VB''' is VB1-3. The language is essentially the same as VB4-6, but the internals are a bit different, they're 16-bit only, and they use [VBX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_Extension) controls instead of the later ActiveX controls. These compilers are almost certainly not in use any more, as they are for 16-bit Windows.
**'''COM VB''' is VB4-6 and [VBA](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/VBA). They are [Win32](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Win32) and use [COM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model) ([OLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Linking_and_Embedding), [ActiveX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX), OCX) components (although VB4 also has a [Win16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API#Versions) version that can use VBX controls).
*'''[VB.Net](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Visual_Basic_.NET)''' isn't really VB, as far as most classic VB programmers are concerned. It's got a VB-like syntax, but the differences are great enough that it's really a separate language.
