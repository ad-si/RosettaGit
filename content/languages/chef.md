[Category:Esoteric Languages](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Esoteric_Languages)
'''Chef''' is an esoteric programming language designed by David Morgan-Mar.

It is based on the manipulation of data values in a number of [stack](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/stack)s (the same idea is used in assembly programming languages).

The joke is that the variables tend to be named after basic foodstuffs,
the stacks are called 'mixing bowls' and the instructions for manipulating them 'mix', 'stir', etc..

A program, then, reads much like a cooking recipe.
