From the [[wp:Turing_(programming_language)|Wikipedia page]]:

:Turing is a [[Pascal]]-like programming language developed in 1982 by Ric Holt and James Cordy, then of University of Toronto, Canada. Turing is a descendant of Euclid, Pascal and SP/k that features a clean syntax and precise machine-independent semantics.
