From the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)):

:Turing is a [Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pascal)-like programming language developed in 1982 by Ric Holt and James Cordy, then of University of Toronto, Canada. Turing is a descendant of Euclid, Pascal and SP/k that features a clean syntax and precise machine-independent semantics.
