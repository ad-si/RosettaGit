'''PowerBASIC''' is a small family of compilers for [DOS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/DOS) and [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows) by PowerBASIC, Inc. Its main selling point is the efficiency of the compiler and its ease of use. (The "easy" part is debatable; working with windows is not as easy as [Visual Basic](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Visual_Basic), but then, almost nothing is.) For a brief history of PowerBASIC, read [its Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBASIC).

## Code example
Many of the [BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/BASIC) examples listed on Rosetta Code will work unchanged in PowerBASIC -- especially the DOS version -- although there are often enough differences between PB and the various other BASICs (especially the Windows versions) to warrant PB-specific examples.
