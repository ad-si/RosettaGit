elastiC is a portable high-level object-oriented interpreted language with a [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C)-like syntax. Its main characteristics are:
*Open Source, freely available, even for commercial purposes.
*Interpreted.
*Portable [bytecode](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/bytecode) compilation.
*Familiar C-like syntax.
*Dynamic typing.
*Automatic real, very fast, Garbage Collection.
*Object Oriented with meta-programming support (a la [Smalltalk](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Smalltalk)).
*Functional programming support (Scheme like closures with lexical scoping, and eval-like functionality).
*Hierarchical Namespaces.
*Rich set of useful built-in types (dynamic arrays, dictionaries, symbols, ...).
*Extensibile with C (you can add functions, types, classes, methods, packages, ...).
*Embeddable in C.
*Small footprint, making it ideal also in embedded systems.


elastiC has been strongly influenced by C, Smalltalk, [Scheme](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Scheme) and [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python) and tries to merge the best characteristics of all these languages, while still coherently maintaining its unique personality.
