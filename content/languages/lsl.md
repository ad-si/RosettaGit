The ['''Linden Scripting Language'''](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linden_Scripting_Language), usually just called '''LSL''' for short, is a language developed by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linden_Lab Linden Labs] for their [Second Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life) virtual world.  LSL allows Second Life objects to sense, respond to events, and interact with the (virtual) world around them, and the Avatars in that world.

## Flavors of LSL
There are currently three flavors of the LSL language
# LSL compiled under [Mono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_(software)) (the most recent)
# The original interpreted version (no longer being developed and only exists for backward compatibility)
# A largely compatible version of LSL that can run in the [OpenSimulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSimulator) virtual world.

## Documentation
There are two popular web sites documenting LSL
# Second Life's own [http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal LSL Portal]
# a user supported [http://lslwiki.net/lslwiki/wakka.php LSL Wiki]

## Libraries
There exists several open source libraries where users share code

## External Editors
There are also many [http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Alternate_Editors external editors] for LSL allowing you to write, syntax check, and (to a limited extent) execute LSL outside of the Second Life environment.  You will need to sign up at [http://secondlife.com Second Life] and have a Second Life account to execute LSL in the virtual world.  Your scripts can exist by themselves in a folder of your inventory, or in an Object in your inventory, but need to be in an Object that is in-world to execute (if an Object containing scripts is taken in to your inventory, the scripts will be suspended and will resume when brought out in to the world again.)
