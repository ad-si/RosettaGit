S-BASIC (the S stands for "structured") was a native-code
compiler for an ALGOL-like dialect of the BASIC programming
language, and ran on 8-bit microcomputers using the Z80 CPU and
the CP/M operating system. (There are a number of CP/M or
Z80 emulators that will allow the compiler to run on Windows
or Linux systems.) The language and the compiler were
developed during the period 1979-1981 by Gilbert Ohnysty, who saw
a need for a true native-code compiler and a language
implementation that preserved BASIC's ease of use and
straight-forward syntax, while incorporating the syntactic and
control-flow features associated with modern programming languages.
