Hoon is the lisp-y runic language used in [https://github.com/urbit/urbit Urbit].
Unlike most other language, it has no reserved keywords and instead relies on two-character symbols called runes, which are converted into AST nodes. Hoon compiles to Nock, the simple combinator-based virtual machine that Urbit runs on top of.
