'''Coco''' is a variant of [CoffeeScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/CoffeeScript), and thus an alternative syntax for [JavaScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/JavaScript). Like [MoonScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/MoonScript), it generally errs on the side of including more features, as opposed to the partly minimalist philosophy of CoffeeScript.

It is described on [https://github.com/satyr/coco GitHub] (where all the documentation currently resides) as being designed according to the following principles:

* Respect JS semantics and idioms.
* Die for DRY.
* [Perl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Perl) over [Ruby](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Ruby).
* Fewer keywords, punctuations and runtime errors.
