'''Common Lisp''', commonly abbreviated '''CL''', is a dialect of the [derived from::Lisp](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/derived_from::Lisp) programming language, standardised by [ANSI](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/ANSI) X3.226-1994.
Developed as a common successor to Maclisp and Lisp Machine Lisp, it is not an implementation but a language specification.
Several implementations of the Common Lisp standard are available, including commercial products and [open source](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/open_source) software.

Common Lisp is a general-purpose programming language, in contrast to Lisp variants such as [Emacs Lisp](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp) and AutoLISP which are embedded extension languages in particular products.
Unlike many earlier Lisps, Common Lisp (like [derived from::Scheme](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/derived_from::Scheme)) uses lexical variable scope.

The "CL-USER> " prompt seen in front of some examples shows that the code was run in a Lisp [read-eval-print loop](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/read-eval-print_loop), or REPL, running interactively in an environment such as [SLIME](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/SLIME).
