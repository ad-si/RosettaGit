This D compiler uses the DMD front end and the LLVM backend. It is very up to date, generally produces the fastest code of all the D compilers, and comes bundled with [tango](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/tango). A significant downside is the lack of exception support in windows (this is a LLVM backend issue).
