GnuCOBOL (formerly OpenCOBOL, and for a short while, GNU Cobol) is a free COBOL compiler, translating COBOL into C, allowing COBOL code to access many C Libraries. Initially created by Keisuke Nishida, and extended by Roger While.  The project is now maintained by Simon Sobisch and Brian Tiffin on behalf of GNU, with the help of many contributors.  The GnuCOBOL source tree copyrights are managed by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

GnuCOBOL was renamed to GNU Cobol as part of becoming of a GNU project, and then the spelling changed to the current, GnuCOBOL.
