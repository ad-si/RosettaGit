Futhark is a small programming language designed to be compiled to efficient GPU code. It is a statically typed, data-parallel, and purely functional array language, and comes with a heavily optimising ahead-of-time compiler that generates GPU code via OpenCL. Futhark is not designed for graphics programming, but instead uses the compute power of the GPU to accelerate data-parallel array computations. The language support regular nested data-parallelism, as well as a form of imperative-style in-place modification of arrays, while still preserving the purity of the language via the use of a uniqueness type system.
