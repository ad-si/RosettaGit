SISAL (Streams and Iteration in a Single Assignment Language) is a general-purpose single assignment functional programming language with strict semantics, implicit parallelism, and efficient array handling. SISAL outputs a dataflow graph in Intermediary Form 1 (IF1). It was derived from [derived from::VAL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/derived_from::VAL) (Value-oriented Algorithmic Language), and adds recursion and finite streams. It has a [Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pascal)-like syntax and was designed to be a common high-level language for numerical programs on a variety of multiprocessors.
