A programming language with extreme pattern matching and declarative syntax, hopefully different enough to be interesting. The inspiration comes mostly from xslt, but data structures are json-like. The main idea is to let your data flow through a series of transforms so it should be easy to specify that flow. Transform steps can be specified as a set of templates with pattern-matching determining which template to apply. Output is generally specified as literals with interpolation of values.
