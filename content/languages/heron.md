Heron is a general-purpose object-oriented language, designed by Christopher Diggins, that strives to be appropriate for large scale project development (at least once it is mature). Heron borrows a number of ideas from functional languages, and offers some new twists on object-oriented programming.[[1](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/#Citation)]

Heron is influenced by the [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C++), [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java) and [Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pascal) programming languages. Heron has built-in support for object-oriented programming, generic programming, metaprogramming, aspect-oriented programming and design by contract techniques. The Heron language design goals include improving reusability of software and reduction of possibility of programmer error. Heron performance is tuned towards heavily polymorphic object-oriented designs.

Heron is effectively a combination of programming language and modeling language. It is designed to allow seamless transitioning between textual and diagrammatic representiation of executable UML (xUML) models. Heron is the first programming language designed specifically to support the model-driven architecture (MDA) paradigm.

Heron has a syntax which resembles [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java), [C#](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C#), [ECMAScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/ECMAScript), and [Scala](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Scala). Heron is primarily an object-oriented language, but borrows many ideas from functional languages, and even some from array-oriented languages.
