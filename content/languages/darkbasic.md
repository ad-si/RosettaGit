'''DarkBASIC''' (a.k.a. '''DB''') is a commercial game creation programming language released by [The Game Creators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Creators). The language is a structured form of [BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/BASIC) and is similar to [AMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOS_(programming_language)) on the [Amiga](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/AmigaOS).

The purpose of the language is game creation using [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft)'s [DirectX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX) from a BASIC programming language. It can create both 2D and 3D games using a lot less code than the equivalent program would take by using more powerful languages such as C++ due to the included libraries.

There are two varieties of DB: the original DarkBASIC (often referred to as '''DarkBASIC Classic''') and '''DarkBASIC Professional''' (a.k.a. '''DBPro'''). Both run under [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft) [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows) only.
