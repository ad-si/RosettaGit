'''Opera''' is a Norwegian web browser created by [Opera Software ASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Software). It uses the [Presto engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presto_(layout_engine)) to present web pages.
Historically, it's been known to be quick at implementing new features, such as being very early with tabbed browsing.

## JavaScript implementations
The latest version of Opera uses a JavaScript engine called Carakan.
