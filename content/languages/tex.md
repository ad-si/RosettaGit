[Category:Encyclopedia](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Encyclopedia)'''''' (the X stands for the greek &Chi; letter and so pronounced as ''ch'' in te''ch''nics, and written with a lowercase 'e' in imitation of the logo) is a [typesetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/typesetting) language and system designed and mostly written by [Donald E. Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth).

See wikipedia [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) for more.
