'''XSLT''', which stands for '''Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations''', is a domain specific [functional](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/functional_programming) language for extracting data from and transforming [XML](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/XML) documents. The language itself uses [XML](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/XML) syntax. It is defined in three pieces:
# '''Extensible Stylesheet Language''' (XSL) is the base language
# '''XPath''' is the expression language used within many of the attributes to address portions of the document and manipulate values
# '''Formatting Objects''' (FO) is an extension for providing page layout and presentation, which has a similar model to PDF
