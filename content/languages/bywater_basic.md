The '''Bywater BASIC Interpreter''' (a.k.a. ''bwbasic'') is a [BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/BASIC) interpreter. It supports a large subset of the [ANSI Standard for Full BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC#Standards), including all of the ANSI Standard for Minimal BASIC. Bywater BASIC was written in [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C), and runs on [Unix](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Unix)-like and [DOS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/DOS)-based systems (including [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows)).

Bywater BASIC can be downloaded from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/bwbasic/ its Sourceforge project].
