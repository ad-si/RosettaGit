Latitude is a prototype-oriented dynamically-typed programming language which supports continuations and first-class scoping objects. Latitude is primarily designed with runtime reflection in mind, allowing the programmer to control the language itself at runtime.


### Primary Features


From the official website:

* Simple syntax borrowing from Ruby, Smalltalk, and Erlang
* Object orientation through prototypes
* First-class scopes
* Automatic garbage collection
* Full continuation support via callCC
* Ruby-style exception handling via catch blocks
* Support for lazy evaluation
* Arbitrary precision arithmetic support
