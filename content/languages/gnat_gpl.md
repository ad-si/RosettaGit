'''GNAT GPL edition''' refers to the versions of the [GNAT](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GNAT) Ada compiler licensed under the GNU Public License (GPL). Prior to 2005 GNAT was distributed under so-called GNAT-modified GPL license (GM GPL), which allowed the code compiled with GNAT and linked to its run-time library to be used commercially. All newer public releases of GNAT distributed by [http://www.adacore.com AdaCore] are licensed under strict GPL. [http://www.adacore.com AdaCore] continues to distribute [GNAT](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GNAT) under GM GPL, sold as a part of its commercial product GNAT Pro.
