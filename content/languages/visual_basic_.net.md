From the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/ Visual Basic Developer Center] website: "With Visual Basic, you can create applications for Windows, the Web, mobile devices, and Office on the .NET Framework". Visual Basic .NET makes it easy to create [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows) form applications quickly and efficiently. The language is [object-oriented](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/object-oriented) and has unique features to speed development and deployment.

Visual Basic .NET, like [C#](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C_sharp) and other .NET languages, runs on the Microsoft [Common Language Runtime](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/runs_on_vm::Common_Language_Runtime) VM.

Not to be confused with [Visual Basic](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Visual_Basic), the original pre-.NET, implementation, which has only a passing resemblance to VB.NET.
