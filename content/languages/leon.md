The Leon system aims to help developers build verified Scala software. It encourages using a small set of core Scala features, but provides unique automation functionality. In particular, Leon can

* verify statically that your program confirms to a given specification and that it cannot crash at run-time
* repair a program for you to ensure that the above holds
* automatically execute and synthesize working functions from partial input/output specifications and test cases.
