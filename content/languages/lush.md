Lush, ([Lisp](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lisp) Universal Shell), is an object-oriented dialect of the [Lisp](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lisp) programming language that was initially developed as a scripting language for machine learning applications, as well as numerical and graphical applications, but can also be used for general purpose, systems, and network programming or administration tasks. It compiles to native [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C) code and includes a multidimensional-array processing engine.[[1](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/#Citation)]
