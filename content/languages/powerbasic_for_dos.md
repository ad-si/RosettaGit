'''PowerBASIC for DOS''' (a.k.a. '''PB/DOS''') is the [DOS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/DOS) compiler for [PowerBASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:PowerBASIC).

Unlike the [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows) versions of PowerBASIC, PB/DOS is very similar to [QBasic](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/QBasic) and other, older [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft) [BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:BASIC)s, and PB/DOS can in fact compile most QBasic and [GW-BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:GW-BASIC) programs unchanged. ([PB/Win](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/PB/Win) and [PB/CC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/PB/CC) use a variation of BASIC that is somewhat similar to [Visual Basic](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Visual_Basic).)
