Dylan is an [imperative](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Programming_paradigm/Imperative), [functional](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Programming_paradigm/Functional) programming language highly inspired by various [Lisp](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lisp)s. Although original prototypes kept Lisp's s-expr based syntax, modern Dylan is written in a somewhat [Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pascal)/[C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C)-inspired syntax. It's object system is notable for being CLOS-style (oriented around generic methods) rather than [Smalltalk](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Smalltalk) message-passing style. It allows for a mix of static and dynamic typing.
