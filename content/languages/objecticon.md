ObjectIcon is an object oriented variant of [Icon](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Icon) based on an early fork of the [Unicon](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Unicon) Project developed by Robert Parlett (one of the co-authors of the Unicon book).
Some of the distinguishing characteristics are:
* a richer set of object oriented keywords
* support for unicode characters
* replacement of the I/O support with a package
* differences in keywords
