'''ELLA''' is a hardware design language from [DRA Malvern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Research_Agency). Implemented in [ALGOL 68RS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/ALGOL_68RS) - "ELLA 2000: A Language for Electronic System Design", J.D. Morison and A.S. Clarke, McGraw-Hill 1993.

algol68toc is derived from a project to translate ELLA into [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C), hence ''ELLA ALGOL 68'' is a cut down verion of [ALGOL 68RS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/ALGOL_68RS) where elements not required for the ELLA translation were not ported.
## Sample
Notes: ELLA Algol68 (in the form on Algol68toC) is missing the formatted transput (input/output), hence the following code sample uses ''print'' and not ''printf''.  It also requires ALGOL 68 RS's PROGRAM, USE and FINISH formalities.

```txt
PROGRAM helloworld CONTEXT VOID
USE standard    
BEGIN      
  print(("Hello, world!", new line))      
END
FINISH

```
