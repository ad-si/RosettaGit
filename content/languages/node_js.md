'''Node.js''' is an event based, asynchronous I/O framework using the V8 JavaScript engine by Google.

Node.js has gained a lot of popularity for using JavaScript outside of the web browser. It has a robust API with support for e.g. file reading, TCP and UDP sockets (both as server and client) etc.
