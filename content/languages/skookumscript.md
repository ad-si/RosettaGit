SkookumScript is the superpowered video game programming language and tool suite that is set to revolutionize the video game industry. It transforms team composition, workflow, and even the thought process of video game development. Simple, powerful and easy to learn, SkookumScript empowers the entire development team to create compelling gameplay (AI, missions, interactive audio, user interfaces, real-time automation and more) with surprisingly few lines of code. SkookumScript has key game concepts such as concurrency and interactivity built in, and leverages context from all areas of workflow such as world editors. Turnaround is lightning-fast, as code can be modified and debugged in real-time on live games. SkookumScript scales painlessly and facilitates large-scale content creation, making it ideal for both major studios and small indie teams. Crafted over more than 12 years by veteran game developers, SkookumScript has been battle-tested on major game titles. It is available as a powerful turn-key SkookumScript Plugin for Unreal Engine 4, and other major game engines are on the way.

SkookumScript is the scripting solution for every genre of video game, on every platform, everywhere.
