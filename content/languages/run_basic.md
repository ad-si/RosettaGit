'''Run BASIC''' is a [web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web_application) server, based on [Liberty BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Liberty_BASIC) (and made by the same company, Shoptalk Systems).

Run BASIC serves a similar purpose to other languages like [ASP](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:ASP), [Perl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Perl), and [PHP](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:PHP); unlike those languages, however, it is not an add-on module to web servers, instead including its own HTTP server. Web pages are generated dynamically by the program. High-level commands automatically generate [HTML](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:HTML), colors, fonts, backgrounds, and [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) (CSS). If needed, [JavaScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:JavaScript) can also be injected into a page. Graphics can be drawn and rendered via code. Files can be fetched from other web sites using GET and POST, and a built-in XML parser can be used to extract data.

Database capability is included via the [SQLite](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:SQLite) database engine.
