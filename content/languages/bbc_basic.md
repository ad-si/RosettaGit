'''BBC BASIC''' is a version of the [BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/BASIC) programming language. It is notable for being one of the few modern dialects that makes no attempt to be compatible to any great degree with [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft) BASICs.

BBC BASIC was originally written for the [BBC Microcomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro) as part of the '''BBC Computer Literacy Project''' under the direction of the [British Broadcasting Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) (thus the name), but now runs on most modern, popular operating systems (and several older and/or less-popular ones).

Wikipedia has [an article about BBC BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC), but the best source of information is probably [http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcbasic.html the BBC BASIC homepage].
