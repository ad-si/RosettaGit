'''BASICA''' is a [BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:BASIC) [interpreter](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/interpreter) developed by [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft) and included with early versions of [PC-DOS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/DOS). It requires ROM BASIC (a BASIC interpreter contained in a ROM chip; a standard feature of the earliest [IBM](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/IBM) PCs) to function correctly. After a few years, BASICA was superseded by [GW-BASIC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:GW-BASIC). (GW-BASIC is identical to BASICA, except that where BASICA requires ROM BASIC, GW-BASIC is entirely contained within the interpreter itself. It was included with several versions of DOS, and was eventually superseded by [QBasic](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/QuickBASIC#QBasic).)
