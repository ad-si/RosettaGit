Gambas is a free development environment based on a [Basic](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Basic) interpreter with object extensions, a bit like Visual Basicâ„¢ (but it is NOT a clone !).

With Gambas, you can quickly design your program [GUI](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GUI) with QT or GTK+, access [MySQL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/MySQL), [PostgreSQL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/PostgreSQL), Firebird, ODBC and [SQLite](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/SQLite) databases, pilot KDE applications with DCOP, translate your program into any language, create network applications easily, make 3D [OpenGL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/OpenGL) applications, make CGI web applications, and so on...
