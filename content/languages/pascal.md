'''Pascal''' is an [imperative](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/imperative_programming) computer programming language, developed in 1970 by [Niklaus Wirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth) as a language particularly suitable for [structured programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/structured_programming). A derivative known as [Object Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Object_Pascal) was designed for [object-oriented](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/object-oriented) programming. Pascal can be used very easily in conjunction with fundamental [discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/discrete_mathematics) as sets are built into the language.

There are actually several varieties of Pascal. The most important ones are:
* Standard Pascal ([ISO](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/ISO) 7185) is the original Pascal standard. However, there are many features missing from that language version, which has led to a wide variety of nonstandard extensions. On the other hand, there are features of Standard Pascal which are seldom implemented by Pascal compilers. A compiler which implements all features of Standard Pascal is [GNU Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GNU_Pascal).
* Extended Pascal (ISO 10206) is a later Pascal standard which adds a lot to the original Pascal standard. However, compilers implementing Extended Pascal are even more rare than those implementing Standard Pascal. GNU Pascal implements most of Extended Pascal as well.
* [Turbo Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) was a very successful Pascal implementation for [DOS](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/DOS) and 16 bit [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows) (the latest version was sold under the name "Borland Pascal 7.0") and became the de-facto standard for Pascal on DOS. Even today many Pascal compilers provide compatibility to Turbo Pascal.
* [Object Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Object_Pascal) is the Pascal dialect used in [Delphi](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Delphi), Borland's successor product to Turbo/Borland Pascal. It extends Pascal with a new object model (in addition to the object model introduced in Turbo Pascal 5.5). This language is also implemented by [Free Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Free_Pascal) and [Lazarus](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lazarus).

## Grammar
The [ISO 7185](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_7185) standard for Pascal uses [Extended Backus–Naur Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus–Naur_Form).
Also [Van Wijngaarden's grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Wijngaarden_grammar) can be used to define
[Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pascal)'s grammar[http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fisher/software/yoyovwg/exs/pascal.vwg].
