K is a proprietary array processing language developed by Arthur Whitney and commercialized by Kx Systems. The language serves as the foundation for kdb, an in-memory, column-based database, and other related financial products. The language, originally developed in 1993, is a variant of [APL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/APL) and contains elements of [Scheme](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Scheme). Advocates of the language emphasize its speed, facility in handling arrays and its expressive syntax.[[1](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/#Citations)]
