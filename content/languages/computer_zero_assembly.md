Computer/zero is a simple instruction set architecture designed to accompany [http://edmundgriffiths.com/degreezero.html Programming degree zero], a short tutorial on computers and machine-level programming for the absolute beginner. It is deliberately minimal, offering only eight instructions, one general-purpose register, and 32 bytes of memory. As a result, it is not only easy to learn but also very easy to implement: the core interpreter for Computer/zero machine code comes to about 15 lines in a high-level language, making it quite feasible for beginners to implement and extend it for themselves. A partly graphical browser-based implementation (written in JavaScript) is available [http://edmundgriffiths.com/czero.html here].
