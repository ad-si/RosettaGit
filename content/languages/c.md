'''C''' is a general-purpose, [procedural](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/procedural_programming), [imperative](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/imperative_programming) computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at the [Bell Telephone Laboratories](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Bell_Labs) for use with the [UNIX](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/UNIX) operating system.
C evolved from its predecessor, [derived from::B](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/derived_from::B).

C has since spread to many other [platforms](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:Platforms), and is now one of the most widely used programming languages.
C has also greatly influenced many other popular languages, such as [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C++) and [Objective-C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Objective-C), which were originally designed as enhancements to C.
People are so familiar with its syntax that many other languages such as [AWK](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/AWK), [PHP](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/PHP), [Java](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Java), [JavaScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/JavaScript), [D](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/D), and [C#](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C_Sharp) deliberately used its "look and feel".
C is the most commonly used programming language for writing system software, though it is also widely used for writing applications.
[C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C) is the ''lingua franca'' of the [open source](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/open_source) community.


## Versions

- '''K&R C''' was the first widely-used form of C.
    It was originally documented in ''The C Programming Language'', published in 1978.
    It is named for the authors, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (also the language's creator).
    Code in this style is virtually nonexistent today.
- '''C89''' (often called '''[ANSI](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/ANSI) C''') is the version of C standardized by ANSI in 1989.
    It is the most commonly used and supported version of the language.
- '''C90''' (often called '''[ISO](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/ISO) C''') is identical to C89, republished by ISO in 1990.
    - '''C99''' is a significant improvement, adopting many features of [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C++) and standardizing common compiler extensions.
    It was standardized by ISO in 1999, and by ANSI in 2000.
    It is primarily supported by commercial C compilers, but most of its features are available in [Clang](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Clang) [GCC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GCC).
    [http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html]
- '''C11''' is the current standard, published in December 2011.
    It is the default for [GCC](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GCC) as of version 5.1.
