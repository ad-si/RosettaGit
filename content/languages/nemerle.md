Nemerle is a high-level, statically-typed programming language for the [.NET](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/.NET) platform. It offers functional, object-oriented and imperative features. It has a simple [C#](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C_sharp)-like syntax and a powerful meta-programming system.

Features that come from the functional land are variants, pattern matching, type inference and parameter polymorphism (aka generics). The meta-programming system allows great compiler extensibility, embedding domain specific languages, partial evaluation and aspect-oriented programming.
