Glee is an experimental array programming language that attempts to deliver stronger string/text manipulation capabilities than those currently offered in languages such as [APL](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/APL), [J](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/J), and [K](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/K), while maintaining their capabilities at manipulating numeric data.

Glee is targeted at applications where scripting languages such as [Perl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Perl) and [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python) are currently the first choice. The designer of Glee expects that it will be able to carve a niche for itself thanks to Glee's vector processing capabilities, as all the competitors are scalar language.[[1](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/#Citation)]
