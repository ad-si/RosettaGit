'''Standard ML''' (SML) is a general-purpose, modular, [functional programming](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/functional_programming) language with [compile-time](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/compile-time) [type checking](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/type_checking) and type inference.
It is popular among compiler writers and programming language researchers, as well as in the development of theorem provers.

SML is a modern descendant of the [derived from::ML](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/derived_from::ML) programming language used in the LCF theorem-proving project.
It is unique among widely used languages in that it has a formal specification, given as typing rules and operational semantics in The Definition of Standard ML (1990, revised and simplified as The Definition of Standard ML (Revised) in 1997).
