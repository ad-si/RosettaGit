BETA is a modern language in the Simula tradition. The resulting language is smaller than Simula in spite of being considerably more expressive. BETA is a strongly typed language like [Simula](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Simula), [Eiffel](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Eiffel) and [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C++), with most type checking being carried out at compile-time. It is well known that it is not possible to obtain all type checking at compile time without sacrificing the expressiveness of the language. BETA has optimum balance between compile-time type checking and run-time type checking.
