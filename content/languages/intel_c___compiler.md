'''Intel C++ Compiler''' (also known as '''icc''' or '''icl''') describes a group of [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:C)/[C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/:Category:C++) compilers from [Intel](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Intel). Compilers are available for [Linux](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Linux), [Microsoft](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Microsoft) [Windows](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Windows), and [Mac OS X](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X).

Intel C++ Compiler belongs to the family of compilers with the Edison Design Group frontend (like the SGI MIPSpro, Comeau C++, Portland Group, and others). The compiler is also notable for being widely used for SPEC CPU Benchmarks of IA-32, x86-64, and Itanium 2 architectures.

The Intel C++ Compiler is available in four forms. It is part of Intel Parallel Studio, the Intel C++ Compiler Professional Edition package, the Intel Compiler Suite package and the Intel Cluster Toolkit, Compiler Edition.
