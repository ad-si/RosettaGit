NESL is a functional language with an ML-like syntax, type inference, and support for parallel programming based on the idea of nested data parallelism. It has been used to teach parallel algorithms.

For more information see the [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/nesl.html NESL language page]. You can also try evaluating some NESL expressions online, using the [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/nesl/nesl_form.html Interactive NESL Interface].
