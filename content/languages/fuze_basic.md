'''FUZE BASIC''' is included, pre-configured and ready-to-run on the FUZE, a computer based on the [Raspberry Pi](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi), but can also be installed, [https://www.fuze.co.uk/getfuzebasic/ free of charge] on a standard [Raspberry Pi](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) with some minor limitations due to a lack of on-board sensors which are added to the FUZE hardware.

<blockquote>
Quotes from the official website (https://www.fuze.co.uk/):

"FUZE BASIC [is a] highly advanced and modernised version of the programming language widely accepted as the easiest to learn and teach."

"The FUZE is a computing platform designed to encourage exploration and experimentation with basic electronics, communications and even robotics while at all times developing a core knowledge of computer programming. It is most of all, incredibly inspirational and for many, a life changing experience as students quickly realise technology is not an inaccessible over-complex mystical art but actually very reachable, very rewarding and downright good fun to boot!"
