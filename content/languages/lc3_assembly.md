[Category:Assembly](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Assembly)
'''LC-3 assembly''' is an assembly language developed by Yale Patt and Sanjay Patel for educational purposes. LC-3 assembly runs on the eponymous hardware (“Little Computer 3”); however, simulations are far more common. Although it has a simplified instruction set, compared to x86 assembly, LC-3 is a viable target for a C compiler.
