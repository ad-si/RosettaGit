"FBSL" stands for “Freestyle BASIC Script Language”. FBSL is an embeddable, '''multi-syntax''', '''all-in-one''' high-level language. Its interpretative layer is a vastly extended superset of traditional BASIC that targets seamless integration of FBSL applications with Windows API and third-party dynamic link libraries. Its integrated Dynamic Assembler and Dynamic C JIT compiler layers enable the user to interleave BASIC code with Intel-style assembly and ANSI C, respectively. Like many modern scripting languages, it contains flavors of Visual BASIC, [QBasic](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/QBasic), [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C), [Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pascal) and [PHP](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/PHP), hence the “Freestyle”. It is especially designed for 32-bit [Win32](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Win32) platforms and can run on Windows 95 SR2 through Windows 8.1. It is also compatible with, and completely functional under, [Linux](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Linux) Wine, Mac OS X Wine, and ReactOS.
