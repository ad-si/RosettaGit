'''TypeScript''' is a free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict superset of [JavaScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/JavaScript), and adds optional static typing and class-based [object-oriented programming language](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/object-oriented_language) programming to the language. Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of [C#](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C_sharp) and creator of [Delphi](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Delphi) and [Turbo Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal), has worked on the development of TypeScript.
