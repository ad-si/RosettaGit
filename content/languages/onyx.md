Onyx is a powerful stack-based, multi-threaded, interpreted, general purpose programming language similar to PostScript. It can be embedded as an extension language similarly to [ficl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/ficl) ([Forth](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Forth)), [guile](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/guile) ([scheme](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/scheme)), [librep](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/librep) ([lisp](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/lisp) dialect), [s-lang](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/s-lang), [Lua](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lua), and [Tcl](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Tcl).

Onyx is perhaps the most advanced stack-based general purpose programming language in existence
It has the following distinguishing features:
* Double-ended stacks are first class objects
* Perl-compatible regular expressions.
* Loadable module system.
* Object-oriented programming (OOP) support similar to that of [Objective-C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Objective-C)
