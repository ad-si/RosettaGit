Wrapl is a dynamic programming language designed for various programming tasks including rapid prototyping, scripts and [GUI](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/GUI) application development.

The key features in Wrapl include:
*  [Object-oriented](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Object-oriented): Every value in Wrapl is an object with a type which is known at [run time](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/run_time). The types form a hierarchy with [multiple inheritance](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/multiple_inheritance).
* Multiple-dispatch: Method dispatch in Wrapl depends on the types and values of all of their arguments.
* Pass-by-reference: Wrapl allows variables to be passed by reference to other functions.
* Functional [closures](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/closures): Functions in Wrapl are first-class objects which may passed to other functions or stored in variables. Functions can both read and write variables declared in surrounding scopes.
* Goal-directed: Every expression in Wrapl can produce 0, 1, or more values. An expression which can produce more than 1 value may be resumed to produce its next value.
