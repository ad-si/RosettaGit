OpenC++ is a version of [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C++) with a Metaobject Protocol. In other words, it is a tool of source-code translation for [C++](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C++). Programmers can easily implement various kinds of translation so that they can define new syntax, new annotation, and new object behavior.
