TIScript is a language that uses [JavaScript](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/JavaScript) as a base with some [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python) features added: classes and namespaces, properties, decorators, etc. TIScript has a compiler producing [bytecode](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/bytecode)s and VM running that bytecodes. VM uses heap with garbage collector.

Please read my article [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/TIScript.aspx TIScript vs JavaScript]. TIScript is hosted on  [http://code.google.com/p/tiscript/ GoogleCode]

Minimal hello-world in TIScript:

```javascript
stdout.println("Hello world");
```
