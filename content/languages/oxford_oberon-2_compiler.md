OBC is the Oxford Oberon-2 Compiler.

It is written in [OCaml](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/OCaml) (with [C](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/C) for the runtime) by Mike Spivey. It formerly used the Boehm [garbage collector](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/garbage_collection), but now includes its own storage manager.
