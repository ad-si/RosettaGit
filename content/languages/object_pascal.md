Object Pascal is an [object-oriented](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/object-oriented) derivative of [Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Pascal) mostly known as the primary programming language of Borland [Delphi](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Delphi). It is also known as the "Delphi programming language" when describing the dialect used by Borland Delphi.

Borland used the name "Object Pascal" for the programming language in the first versions of Borland Delphi, but later renamed it to the "Delphi programming language". The [Free Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Free_Pascal) compiler supports different modes/dialects and besides [Turbo Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal), [Delphi](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Delphi) and MacPascal, [Object Pascal](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Object_Pascal) can be selected.
