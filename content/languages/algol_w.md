Algol W is a successor to [Algol 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algol_60) closely based on A
Contribution to the Development of ALGOL by [Niklaus Wirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth)
and [C. A. R. Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.A.R._Hoare). It includes dynamically
allocated records, string handling, complex numbers and a standard I/O
system. A copy of the Algol W Language Description can be found on Karl
Kleine's [http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/history.html Historic Documents in Computer Science]
page. [http://everything2.com/title/Algol%2520W Dabcanboulet's Algol W @ Everything2]
page contains an excellent
history and tutorial.

[http://www.jampan.co.nz/~glyn/ aw2c] is a new compiler for the Algol W
language. It is a complete implementation of the language described in
the Algol W Language Description, June 1972. aw2c should be able to
compile code intended for the [OS/360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360) Algol W compilers
with little or no modification. See the aw2c manual for more details.

aw2c correctly compiles Tony Marsland's computer [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chess) player
[http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~tony/Public/Awit-Wita-ComputerChess/ Awit]
and Hendrik Boom's [http://mtn-host.prjek.net/projects/a68h/ A68H]
[Algol 68](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Algol_68) compiler.
