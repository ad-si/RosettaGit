Tela. TEnsor LAnguage, (pronounced teh-lah) is a numerical computing
environment mainly targeted for numerical simulation pre- and
post-processing work.  The language supports
arbitrary rank arrays, and has powerful programming capabilities including
[Fortran 90](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Fortran_90) style vector notation.
Two- and three- dimensional graphics is implemented by calling PlotMTV.
For 2D graphics, the SPPC interface is also available. Tela is not a [MATLAB](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/MATLAB) clone, although the scopes of the two programs partly overlap. Tela is both faster and more general than Matlab; however, Matlab has more functions for specific tasks such as signal processing.
