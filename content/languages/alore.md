Alore is an [object-oriented programming](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/object-oriented_programming) language with a clean syntax that resembles [Python](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Python) and [Lua](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lua). Alore is optionally-typed like Google Dart: it is both a dynamic scripting language and a general-purpose language with static typing. It is aimed at diverse programming tasks, from short scripts to complex applications. Alore also allows you to freely mix static and dynamic typing within a program.
