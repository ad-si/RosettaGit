RosettaGit isn't the only project which aims to document tasks
in multiple languages.
Other projects do exist.
Here's a list.
Feel free to update and add to it.

# Archive

These sites were online at one point, but have since vanished with no
forwarding address. If you know of online, existing archived copies,
please link to them. Also, Rosetta Code may be interested in hosting
static copies of such sites where they're at risk of disappearing.
Having such content disappear is counter to the goals of this site.

If a site is listed in this section, but is actually still live, please
move it back to the live section.
