## Task

Implement a   ''' [[HQ9+]] '''   interpreter or compiler.





## Ada


see [[Execute HQ9+/Ada]]


## Agena

Tested with Agena 2.9.5 Win32

```agena
# HQ9+ interpreter

# execute an HQ9+ program in the code string - code is not case sensitive
hq9 := proc( code :: string ) is
    local hq9Accumulator := 0; # the HQ9+ accumulator
    local hq9Operations  :=    # table of HQ9+ operations and their implemntations
          [ "q" ~ proc() is print( code ) end
          , "h" ~ proc() is print( "Hello, world!" ) end
          , "9" ~ proc() is
                      local writeBottles := proc( bottleCount :: number, message :: string ) is
                                                print( bottleCount

## C++

Basically the same as the C example, although this has been C++'ified with strings and streams.

```cpp
void runCode(string code)
{
    int c_len = code.length();
    unsigned accumulator=0;
    int bottles;
    for(int i=0;i<c_len;i++)
    {
        switch(code[i])
        {
            case 'Q':
                cout << code << endl;
                break;

            case 'H':
                cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
                break;

            case '9':
                //Nice bottles song alg. from RC :)
                bottles = 99;
                do {
                    cout << bottles << " bottles of beer on the wall" << endl;
                    cout << bottles << " bottles of beer" << endl;
                    cout << "Take one down, pass it around" << endl;
                    cout << --bottles << " bottles of beer on the wall" << endl << endl;
                } while( bottles > 0 );
                break;

            case '+':
                //Am I the only one finding this one weird? :o
                accumulator++;
                break;
        }
    }
};
```

### Impure approach

     where eval' [] = ()
           eval' (x::xs) | be 'H' = h() `seq` eval' xs
                         | be 'Q' = q() `seq` eval' xs
                         | be '9' = n() `seq` eval' xs
                         | be '+' = p() `seq` eval' xs
                         | else = fail ("Unrecognized " ++ x)

                               be c = char.upper x == c
                               h () = writen "Hello, world!"
                               q () = writen src

                               n () = bottles [99,98..1]
                                  where bottles [] = ()
                                        bottles (x::xs) = rec write
                                          (show x) " bottles of beer of the wall\r\n"
                                          (show x) " bottles of beer\r\n"
                                          "Take one down, pass it around\r\n"
                                          `seq` bottles xs

### Pure version


An interpreter itself has no side effects:


```ela
open list char

eval src = eval' src 0
     where eval' [] a = []
           eval' (x::xs) a | be 'H' = h :: eval' xs a
                           | be 'Q' = q :: eval' xs a
                           | be '9' = force n :: eval' xs a
                           | be '+' = eval' xs (a+1)
                           | else   = fail "Invalid instruction."
                           where be c = char.upper x == c
                                 h = "Hello, world!"
                                 q  = src
                                 n = (& bottles [99,98..1])
                                     where bottles [] = ""
                                           bottles (x::xs) =
                                             show x ++ " bottles of beer of the wall\r\n"
                                             ++ show x ++ " bottles of beer\r\n"
                                             ++ "Take one down, pass it around\r\n"
                                             ++ bottles xs
```


It slightly alters an original HQ9+ specification. HQ9+ is an impure language that does console output. However console output is the only interaction that a user can see when executing HQ9+ program. This interpreter doesn't output to console but instead generates a list with all outputs. An accumulator is moved to the interpter arguments and the need for a reference cell is eliminated. Once an interpreter completes a client code can output to console using monads like so:


```ela
open imperative monad io

print_and_eval src = do
  res <- return $ eval src
  return $ each print res
  where print x = do putStrLn x

print_and_eval "HQ9+" ::: IO
```

## Fortran

This is F77 style except for the END SUBROUTINE HQ9, since F90+ allows the END statement to name its subroutine, and more seriously, the SELECT CASE construction that avoids interminable IF ... THEN ... ELSE IF ... sequences or even, a computed GO TO. The obvious data structure is the CHARACTER type, introduced with F77.

The only difficulty lies in the phasing of the various components of the recital (note the lines ending with commas or periods), and especially, producing correct grammar for the singular case. One could simply produce the likes of *"1 bottles of beer", or perhaps "1 bottle(s) of beer" but having been hounded for decades by compilers quibbling over syntax trivia, a certain sensitivity has arisen. For this case, the requirement is to append a "s" or not to "bottle" and the task is quite vexing because Fortran does not allow within expressions syntax such as
```Fortran
"bottle" // IF (B.NE.1) THEN "s" FI // " of beer"
```
 so alternative schemes must be devised. There are many possibilities. The output line could be written piecemeal using the "non-advancing" options introduced in F90 with the "s" being written or not, or, the output line could be developed piecemeal in a CHARACTER variable in a similar way then written in one go. Alternatively, a character variable SUFFIX could be employed, which contains either "s" or " " with its usage being <code>..."bottle"//SUFFIX(1:LSTNB(SUFFIX))//...</code> where function LSTNB fingers the last non-blank character (if function TRIM or LEN_TRIM are unavailable), or, with F2003 there is a facility whereby SUFFIX can be declared with a varying length so as to be either "s" or "". Still another ploy would be to replace the "s" by a "null" character (character code zero) that will be passed over by the device showing the output. Or maybe not...

However, because the tail end of the recital does not conform to the structure of the earlier verses, it seemed easier to combine the singular case with the coda, especially since "No bottles" is to be produced instead of "0 bottles". It would be easy enough to devise a function CARDINAL(N) that would return "Ninety-nine", ... "One", "No" but the required code would swamp the rest of the project.

So, there is a careful factorisation of the text phrases into FORMAT and WRITE statements. Note that "free-format" output (as with <code>WRITE (6,*)</code>) starts in the second column, whereas formatted output starts in the first column. Inspection of the code file HQ9.exe shows that the compiler has recognised that the multiple appearances of the text literals "bottles" (three) and "bottle" (two) are the same and there is only one value of each constant in the code file. However, it has not noticed that the text "bottle" can be extracted from "bottles", which could in turn be found within a larger text literal "No bottles of beer on the wall" which also contains the subsequence " on the wall" - perhaps the code to do this would consume more space than would be saved by having a single multiple-use text constant in the code for those, or perhaps the problem is just too difficult in general to be worth the effort of devising and executing a worthwhile analysis, given that only a few bytes might be saved in a code file of 480Kb. This of course must contain the format interpretation subsystem and so forth, not just the code for the Fortran source. Even so, this program (with minor changes to the syntax) could be written in Fortran IV for an IBM1130, and would run in a computer with a total memory size of 8Kb. On such systems, much thought would go in to minimising space lost to verbose texts and good exposition as well as such reuse opportunities: gaining access to 32Kb or even 64Kb systems would be a great relief. But these days, memory space is not at a premium, and we are told that modern compilers produce excellent code.


```Fortran

       CHARACTER*(*) CODE	!One operation code per character.
       INTEGER I,B	!Steppers.

            WRITE (6,*) CODE	!Thus.
           CASE("9")		!Recite "99 bottles of beer"...
            DO B = 99,2,-1	!Grammar is to be upheld, so the singular case is special.
              WRITE (6,1) B,"bottles"," on the wall,",B,"bottles","."	!Two lots: number, text, text.
    1         FORMAT (I2,1X,A," of beer",A)	!Exhausted by the first triplet, so a new line for the second.
              WRITE (6,2)			!Now for the reduction.
    2         FORMAT ("Take one down, pass it around,")	!Announce.
              IF (B.GT.2) WRITE (6,1) B - 1,"bottles"," on the wall."	!But, not for the singular state.
            END DO		!Recite the next stanza.
            WRITE (6,1) 1,"bottle"," on the wall,",1,"bottle","."	!The singular case. No longer "bottles".
            WRITE (6,2)						!There's nothing so lonesome, morbid or drear,
            WRITE (6,*) "No bottles of beer on the wall."	!Than to stand at the bar of a pub with no beer.
            WRITE (6,*) "Go to the store, buy some more."	!Take action.
           CASE DEFAULT		!Denounce any unknown operation codes.
            WRITE (6,*) "Unrecognised code:",CODE(I:I)	!This is why a space is treated separately.
          END SELECT		!So much for that operation code.

## OCaml

Regrettably, HQ9+ suffers from remarkably poor implementations, even though the spec nailed down every aspect of the language (apart from the exact lyrics of the '9' operation, this obviously to allow for localization.) What's worse, the only implementation linked from the spec, when it was accessible, was an OCaml work that <i>refused to implement the '+' operation</i> among its several other deviations. The following code borrows 'beer' from its page.


```ocaml
let hq9p line =
  let accumulator = ref 0 in
  for i = 0 to (String.length line - 1) do
    match line.[i] with
    | 'h' | 'H' -> print_endline "Hello, world!"
    | 'q' | 'Q' -> print_endline line
    | '9' -> beer 99
    | '+' -> incr accumulator
  done
```



## PARI/GP

Unlike many other implementations, this version will not overflow when the accumulator hits 2<sup>64</sup> (or as low as 2<sup>31</sup> in some versions).

The lyrics are based on the reference implementation.  The endline and case-insensitivity are from an example in the spec.

```parigp
beer(n)={
  if(n == 1,
    print("1 bottle of beer on the wall");
    print("1 bottle of beer");
    print("Take one down and pass it around");
    print("No bottles of beer on the wall")
  ,
    print(n" bottles of beer on the wall");
    print(n" bottles of beer");
    print("Take one down and pass it around");
    print(n-1," bottles of beer on the wall\n");
    beer(n-1)
  )
};
HQ9p(s)={
  my(accum=0,v=Vec(s));
  for(i=1,#s,
    if(v[i] == "H" || v[i] == "h", print("Hello, world!"); next);
    if(v[i] == "Q" || v[i] == "q", print(s); next);
    if(v[i] == "9", beer(99); next);
    if(v[i] == "+", accum++, error("Nasal demons"))
  )
};
```


Sample input/output:

```txt
>HQ9p("qqqq")
qqqq
qqqq
qqqq
qqqq
```



## Perl

This implementation uses the ''switch'' feature.

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use warnings;
use strict;
use feature qw(say switch);

my @programme = <> or die "No input. Specify a program file or pipe it to the standard input.\n";

for (@programme) {
    for my $char (split //) {
        given ($char) {
            when ('H') { hello()             }
            when ('Q') { quinne(@programme)  }
            when ('9') { bottles()           }
            default    { die "Unknown instruction $char.\n" } # Comment this line to ignore other instructions.
        }
    }
}

sub hello {
    print 'Hello World';
}

sub quinne {
    print @programme;
}

sub bottles {
    for my $n (reverse 0 .. 99) {
        my $before = bottle_count($n);
        my $after  = bottle_count($n - 1);
        my $action = bottle_action($n);
        say "\u$before of beer on the wall, $before of beer.";
        say "$action, $after of beer on the wall.";
        say q() if $n;
    }
}

sub bottle_count {
    my $n = shift;
    given ($n) {
        when    (-1) { return '99 bottles'      }
        when    (0)  { return 'no more bottles' }
        when    (1)  { return '1 bottle'        }
        default      { return "$n bottles"      }
    }
}

sub bottle_action {
    my $n = shift;
    return 'Take one down and pass it around' if $n > 0;
    return 'Go to the store and buy some more';
}
```



## Perl 6

The spec is kind of vague about how to do error handling... and whether white space is significant... and how the accumulator should be accessed... and pretty much everything else too.


```perl6
class HQ9Interpreter {
    has @!code;
    has $!accumulator;
    has $!pointer;

    method run ($code) {
        @!code = $code.comb;
        $!accumulator = 0;
        $!pointer = 0;
        while $!pointer < @!code {
            given @!code[$!pointer].lc {
                when 'h' { say 'Hello world!' }
                when 'q' { say @!code }
                when '9' { bob(99) }

## PowerShell

I'm not sure why, but it bothered me that the '+' function of HQ9+ was completely useless.  So I added the <code>-Global</code>
switch option.  When specified it creates and/or increments a variable named '+' in the global scope.

This program treats all text except for 'H','Q','9' and '+' as whitespace and when 'Q' is called, returns the exact text.  This
is only my preference and could be easily modified.

As far as I can tell, there are no errors in HQ9+; but, supposing there are, a 'Default' could be added to the switch statement.

```PowerShell

function Invoke-HQ9PlusInterpreter ([switch]$Global)
{
    $sb = New-Object -TypeName System.Text.StringBuilder

    for ($i = 99; $i -gt 2; $i--)
    {

                     "{0,2} bottles of beer! Take one down, pass it around, " +
                     "{1,2} bottles of beer on the wall.`n") -f $i, ($i - 1))) | Out-Null

## Racket


Getting HQ9+ code from standard output is not easy without a trailing newline.
So I've extended the language (maybe the program could do with a flag to allow/
disallow newlines). To make up for that slackness, this implementation is
strictly case-sensitive.


```racket
#lang racket
; if we `for` over the port, we won't have the program in memory for 'Q'

   (for/fold ((A 0))
     ((token (in-string the-program)))
     (case token

Usage:

```ruby
var hq9 = HQ9Interpreter();
hq9.run("hHq+++Qq");
```


```txt

Hello world!
Hello world!
hHq+++Qq
hHq+++Qq
hHq+++Qq

```


Or start a REPL (Read Execute Print Loop) and interact at the command line:

```ruby
var hq9 = HQ9Interpreter();
loop {
    var in = read('HQ9+>', String) \\ break;
    hq9.run(in)
}
```

### ==Details==


Input to this sheet is given by placing the entire source as a single <code><nowiki><code/></nowiki></code> element. For example, to run the example program <code>qqqq</code>, use the sheet to transform the document


```xml><code>qqqq</code></lang


Newlines are added in roughly the same places as in the C version. For example, the program <code>qqqq</code> results in four lines of output rather than one long line.

XSLT has no meaningful way to process a write-only variable like the accumulator, so <code>+</code> is a no-op.

Characters other than <code>HQhq9+</code> are no-ops, but are echoed verbatim by <code>Q</code>/<code>q</code>.

### ==Details==


This sheet demonstrates the use of a tail-recursive template to simulate a narrowly mutable state, which is used for both the output and the accumulator.

Input to this sheet is given by placing one or more sources as <code><nowiki><code/></nowiki></code> elements. For example, to run the example program <code>qqqq</code>, use the sheet to transform the document


```xml><code>qqqq</code></lang


or the programs <code>qqqq</code> and <code>++++</code> can be run in the same pass by transforming


```xml><programs

  <code>qqqq</code>
  <code>++++</code>
</programs>
```


The output document is a <code><nowiki><results/></nowiki></code> element containing a <code><nowiki><result/></nowiki></code> element for each <code><nowiki><code/></nowiki></code> element processed from the input. If a <code>+</code> appeared in the program, the <code><nowiki><result/></nowiki></code> element will indicate the final value of the accumulator in its <code>accumulator</code> attribute. For example, the output for the latter example, would be


```xml><results><result
qqqq
qqqq
qqqq
qqqq
</result><result accumulator="4"/></results>
```



### =bottles.xsl=


This sheet defines a value for the variable <code>$entire-bottles-song</code> (see [[99 Bottles of Beer]] for the general idea).
