## Task

Write a subroutine, function, whatever it may be called in your language, that takes an integer number and returns an English text sequence starting with the English cardinal representation of that integer, the word 'is' and then the English cardinal representation of the count of characters that made up the first word, followed by a comma.

Continue the sequence by using the previous count word as the first word of the next phrase, append 'is' and the cardinal count of the letters in ''that'' word.

Continue until you reach four. Since four has four characters, finish by adding the words 'four is magic' and a period. All integers will eventually wind up at four.

For instance, suppose your are given the integer '''3'''. Convert '''3''' to '''Three''', add ''' is ''', then the cardinal character count of three, or '''five''', with a comma to separate if from the next phrase. Continue the sequence '''five is four,''' (five has four letters), and finally, '''four is magic.'''

      '''Three is five, five is four, four is magic.'''

For reference, here are outputs for 0 through 9.

      Zero is four, four is magic.
      One is three, three is five, five is four, four is magic.
      Two is three, three is five, five is four, four is magic.
      Three is five, five is four, four is magic.
      Four is magic.
      Five is four, four is magic.
      Six is three, three is five, five is four, four is magic.
      Seven is five, five is four, four is magic.
      Eight is five, five is four, four is magic.
      Nine is four, four is magic.


;Some task guidelines:
:* You may assume the input will only contain integer numbers.
:* Cardinal numbers between 20 and 100 may use either hyphens or spaces as word separators but they must use a word separator. ('''23''' is '''twenty three''' or '''twenty-three''' not '''twentythree'''.)
:* Cardinal number conversions should follow the [[wp:Long_and_short_scales| English short scale]]. (billion is 1e9, trillion is 1e12, etc.)
:* Cardinal numbers should not include commas. ('''20140''' is '''twenty thousand one hundred forty''' not '''twenty thousand, one hundred forty'''.)
:* When converted to a string, '''100''' should be '''one hundred''', not '''a hundred''' or '''hundred''', '''1000''' should be '''one thousand''', not '''a thousand''' or '''thousand'''.
:* When converted to a string, there should be no '''and''' in the cardinal string. '''130''' should be '''one hundred thirty''' not '''one hundred and thirty'''.
:* When counting characters, count ''all'' of the characters in the cardinal number including spaces and hyphens. '''One hundred fifty-one''' should be '''21''' not '''18'''.
:* The output should follow the format "N is K, K is M, M is ... four is magic." (unless the input is 4, in which case the output should simply be "four is magic.")
:* The output can either be the return value from the function, or be displayed from within the function.
:* You are encouraged, though not mandated to use proper sentence capitalization.
:* You may optionally support negative numbers. '''-7''' is '''negative seven'''.
:* Show the output here for a small representative sample of values, at least 5 but no more than 25. You are free to choose which which numbers to use for output demonstration.


You can choose to use a library, (module, external routine, whatever) to do the cardinal conversions as long as the code is easily and freely available to the public.

If you roll your own, make the routine accept at minimum any integer from 0 up to 999999. If you use a pre-made library, support at least up to unsigned 64 bit integers. (or the largest integer supported in your language if it is less.)

Four is magic is a popular code-golf task. '''This is not code golf.''' Write legible, idiomatic and well formatted code.<BR>

## Factor

Factor's <code>math.text.english</code> vocabulary does most of the heavy lifting. Since <code>number>text</code> produces <tt><i>" and "</i></tt> and <tt><i>","</i></tt> in its output, they are removed with a regular expression.

```factor
USING: ascii formatting io kernel make math.text.english regexp
sequences ;
IN: rosetta-code.four-is-magic

! Strip " and " and "," from the output of Factor's number>text
! word with a regular expression.
: number>english ( n -- str )
    number>text R/ and |,/ "" re-replace ;

! Return the length of the input integer's text form.
! e.g. 1 -> 3
: next-len ( n -- m ) number>english length ;

! Given a starting integer, return the sequence of lengths
! terminating with 4.
! e.g. 1 -> { 1 3 5 4 }
: len-chain ( n -- seq )
    [ [ dup 4 = ] [ dup , next-len ] until , ] { } make ;
