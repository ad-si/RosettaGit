{{draft task}}In [[Remote agent]], a game is described where an agent interacts with a simple world of walls, balls and squares, and a component is described that marshals commands between the simulation environment and the logic code behind the agent.

The goal conditions for the game are to get all balls in squares of matching colors, in as few turns as possible.

Using an [[Remote agent/Agent interface|interface]] for your language write a program that attempts to reach these goals. The exact agent behavior within the simulated environment is unspecified.

// The agent's awareness is quite limited.  It has no representation of the
// maze, which direction it is facing, or what it did last.  It notices and
// remembers just three things:  The color of the sector just entered, the
// presense and color of any ball there, and the presense and color of any
// ball it is holding.
var sectorColor, sectorBall, agentBall byte

// Package level variable to simplify function calls.
var stream ifc.Streamer

func Agent(s ifc.Streamer) {
    stream = s
    // randomness used for movement
    rand.Seed(time.Now().Unix())
    // handshake
    hs := stream.Rec()
    if hs != ifc.Handshake {
        log.Fatal("agent: thats no handshake")

// It is used by the agent as a test for receipt of a color-based event.

// Move moves one sector in a random direction.
// It retries on bumps and doesn't return until a forward command succeeds.
// It expects a color event on a successful move and terminates if it doesn't
// get one.

// where the sector is not empty, but contains a ball of the wrong color.
// In this case, drop will drop the ball on the nearest empty sector,
// in hopes that it has at least moved the ball near a sector where it
// might ultimately go.

// FindMatching is only called when agent has a ball.
// FindMatching finds a sector where the color matches the ball the agent
// is holding and which does not already contain a matching ball.
// It does not necessarily find an empty matching sector.

// Drop is only called when the agent has a ball.  Unlike get() however,
// drop() can be called whether the sector is empty or not.  drop() means
// drop as soon as possible, so if the sector is full, drop() will wander
// at random looking for an empty sector.

Sample agent (''not'' a good or smart player of the game; just to show how to program to the interface).
