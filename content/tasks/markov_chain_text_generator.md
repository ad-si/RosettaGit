## Task

This task is about coding a Text Generator using Markov Chain algorithm.

A Markov chain algorithm basically determines the next most probable suffix word for a given prefix.

To do this, a Markov chain program typically breaks an input text (training text) into a series of words,
then by sliding along them in some fixed sized window, storing the first N words as a prefix and then
the N + 1 word as a member of a set to choose from randomly for the suffix.

As an example, take this text with N = 2:

now he is gone she said he is gone for good

this would build the following table:

```txt

PREFIX               SUFFIX
now he               is
he is                gone, gone
is gone              she, for
gone she             said
she said             he
said he              is
gone for             good
for good             (empty) if we get at this point, the program stops generating text

```

To generate the final text choose a random PREFIX, if it has more than one SUFFIX, get one at random,
create the new PREFIX and repeat until you have completed the text.

Following our simple example, N = 2, 8 words:

```txt

random prefix: gone she
suffix: said
new prefix: she + said
new suffix: he
new prefix: said + he
new suffix: is
... and so on

gone she said he is gone she said

```

The bigger the training text, the better the results.
You can try this text here: [http://paulo-jorente.de/text/alice_oz.txt alice_oz.txt]

Create a program that is able to handle keys of any size (I guess keys smaller than 2 words would be
pretty random text but...) and create output text also in any length.
Probably you want to call your program passing those numbers as parameters. Something like: markov( "text.txt", 3, 300 )







## C++

In this implementation there is no repeated suffixes!

'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes filled
with tears again as she went slowly after it: 'I never was so small as this before,
never! And I declare it's too bad, that it is!' As she said this she looked
down into its face in some alarm. This time there were three gardeners at it,

No, but I am sure we shall sometime come to some place. But day by day passed away, and they found themselves in the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the big Head; so she took courage and answered: I am Dorothy, answered the girl, if he will see you, said the soldier who had taken her message to the Wizard, although he does not like to go back to Oz, and claim his promise. Yes, said the Woodman, so get behind me and I will tell you my story. So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the water's edge. Who are you and where are you going? My name is Dorothy, said the girl, let us go. And she handed the basket to the Scarecrow. There were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough and untilled. Toward evening

## Lua


Not sure whether this is correct, but I am sure it is quite inefficient. Also not written very nicely.

Computes keys of all lengths <= N. During text generation, if a key does not exist in the dictionary, the first (least recent) word is removed, until a key is found (if no key at all is found, the program terminates).

Markov chain text generation:

Great Oz, said Dorothy. The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat
down to breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey. The
sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly, and Dorothy did not know
anything about the charm of the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon
the lining. These, she thought, must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was
so large a house, that she did not like the look of the creature, but on
the whole she thought it must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.
'Would you like cats if you were me?' 'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a
melancholy tone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's
the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I've been changed
in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I
almost think I can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me, if you
like. If Oz will not give you any brains you will be the wisest man in all
the Land of Oz, said Dorothy, and I am thankful I am made of straw and
cannot be easily damaged.

"The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another corner and waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute I shall melt away. I'm very sorry, indeed, said Dorothy, who was truly sorry for him. If you will help me sew the silk together, we will begin to work on our balloon. So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin again, it was very like having a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. 'But it's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a young man when the balloon brought me here, and I am only a little girl.

So she chose a number of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her slaves. Perhaps not, said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; you're a humbug. Exactly so! declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if it were not one of the shoes she owned half the power of the Golden Cap; but if she could only get back to Kansas. The Silver Shoes, said the Good Witch, have wonderful powers. And one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She thought she must have a basket to ride in, he said. So he sent the"
