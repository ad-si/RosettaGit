Translate the spelled-out English name of a number to a number. You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language's default bounded integer type, if that's less).

Support for inputs other than positive integers (like zero, negative integers, fractions and floating-point numbers) is optional.

* [[Number names]] â€” the reverse operation.


## D

This uses the D module from the Number names task.

## Perl

The following code reads a file line-by-line. It echos comment lines starting with a hashmark and blank lines. Remaining lines are output followed by an arrow "=>" and any non-negative integer number names translated into numbers, e.g., a line with "ninety-nine" is output like this: "ninety-nine => 99".

This solution uses "Number names" from [[Number_names#Ruby | here]]
```ruby
require 'number_names'

  words = num.downcase.gsub(/(,| and |-)/,' ').split
  if words[0] =~ /(minus|negative)/
