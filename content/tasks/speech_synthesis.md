This calls the SAPI5 API directly, it does not need an external program.

## C

Following shining examples of <code>exec</code>ing external programs around here:

```c
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void talk(const char *s)
{
	pid_t pid;
	int status;

	pid = fork();
	if (pid < 0) {
		perror("fork");
		exit(1);
	}

	if (pid == 0) {
		execlp("espeak", "espeak", s, (void*)0);
		perror("espeak");
		_exit(1);
	}

	waitpid(pid, &status, 0);
	if (!WIFEXITED(status) || WEXITSTATUS(status) != 0)
		exit(1);
}

int main()
{
	talk("This is an example of speech synthesis.");
	return 0;
}
```


## C#
You need to 'Add Reference' to the COM "Microsoft Speech Object Library" in your Preferences.

```c#
using SpeechLib;

namespace Speaking_Computer
{
  public class Program
  {
    private static void Main()
    {
      var voice = new SpVoice();
      voice.Speak("This is an example of speech synthesis.");
    }
  }
}
```



## Clojure

```clojure
(use 'speech-synthesis.say)
(say "This is an example of speech synthesis.")
```



## GlovePIE


```glovepie
if var.number=0 then
var.number=1
say("This is an example of speech synthesis.")
endif
```



## Go

Here's a library solution, but using a library written from scratch in Go.

```go
package main

import (
    "go/build"
    "log"
    "path/filepath"

    "github.com/unixpickle/gospeech"
    "github.com/unixpickle/wav"
)

const pkgPath = "github.com/unixpickle/gospeech"
const input = "This is an example of speech synthesis."

func main() {
    p, err := build.Import(pkgPath, ".", build.FindOnly)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    d := filepath.Join(p.Dir, "dict/cmudict-IPA.txt")
    dict, err := gospeech.LoadDictionary(d)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    phonetics := dict.TranslateToIPA(input)
    synthesized := gospeech.DefaultVoice.Synthesize(phonetics)
    wav.WriteFile(synthesized, "output.wav")
}
```



## Groovy

Mac only:

```groovy
'say "This is an example of speech synthesis."'.execute()
```



## Haskell


```haskell

import System

say x = system $ "espeak " ++ show x

main = say "This is an example of speech synthesis."

```



## JavaScript

```javascript
var voice = new ActiveXObject("SAPI.SpVoice");
voice.speak("This is an example of speech synthesis.");
```



## Julia

It seems that this and similar tasks can reduce to how the language can call an external program. Using the Julia REPL:

```julia

julia> a = "hello world"
"hello world"

julia> run(`espeak $a`)

```



## Kotlin

Note that this code does not work on Windows 10.

Note also that Kotlin Native does not support the automatic translation of C function-like macros such as WIFEXITED and WEXITSTATUS.

Whilst it is often possible to wrap such macros in 'ordinary' C functions and then expose the latter to Kotlin via a .klib, it is not worth the effort here. I have therefore confined myself to simply reporting a non-zero error status.


```scala
// Kotlin Native v0.6.2

import kotlinx.cinterop.*
import platform.posix.*

fun talk(s: String) {
    val pid = fork()
    if (pid < 0) {
       perror("fork")
       exit(1)
    }
    if (pid == 0) {
       execlp("espeak", "espeak", s, null)
       perror("espeak")
       _exit(1)
    }
    memScoped {
        val status = alloc<IntVar>()
        waitpid(pid, status.ptr, 0)
        if (status.value > 0) println("Exit status was ${status.value}")
    }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    talk("This is an example of speech synthesis.")
}
```



## Liberty BASIC

Assumes that 'espeak' is available at the path shown.

```lb

## Locomotive Basic


Both hardware and software-only speech synthesizers exist for the CPC. A software-only solution, [http://www.cpc-power.com/index.php?page=detail&num=4372 Speech 1.1] by Superior Software (1986), supplies three BASIC extension commands (RSXes), "|say", "|speak", and "|pitch":

## REXX

Programming note:   This REXX program uses a freeware program   NIRCMD   to interface with the Microsoft Windows speech synthesizer program   '''SAM''',   a text to speech using a male voice.   SAM can possibly be configured to use other voices with later releases of Windows.   More recent Microsoft Windows have another speech synthesizer program:   ANNA.

```rexx
/*REXX program uses a command line interface to invoke Windows SAM for speech synthesis.*/
parse arg t                                      /*get the (optional) text from the C.L.*/
if t=''  then exit                               /*Nothing to say?    Then exit program.*/
dquote= '"'
rate= 1                                          /*talk:   -10 (slow)   to   10 (fast). */
                                                 /* [↓]  where the rubber meets the road*/
'NIRCMD'  "speak text"  dquote  t  dquote   rate /*NIRCMD  invokes Microsoft's Sam voice*/
                                                 /*stick a fork in it,  we're all done. */
```

Note:   The name of the above REXX program is   '''speak.rex'''

'''usage'''   using the command:

```txt

speak This is an example of speech synthesis.

```



## Ruby

Using this module to encapsulate operating system lookup

```ruby
module OperatingSystem
  require 'rbconfig'
  module_function
  def operating_system
    case RbConfig::CONFIG["host_os"]
    when /linux/i
      :linux
    when /cygwin|mswin|mingw|windows/i
      :windows
    when /darwin/i
      :mac
    when /solaris/i
      :solaris
    else
      nil
    end
  end
  def linux?;   operating_system == :linux;   end
  def windows?; operating_system == :windows; end
  def mac?;     operating_system == :mac;     end
end
```


Uses <code>espeak</code> on Linux, <code>say</code> on Mac, and the win32 SAPI library on Windows.

```ruby
load 'operating_system.rb'

def speak(text)
  if OperatingSystem.windows?
    require 'win32/sapi5'
    v = Win32::SpVoice.new
    v.Speak(text)
  elsif OperatingSystem.mac?
    IO.popen(["say"], "w") {|pipe| pipe.puts text}
  else
    # Try to run "espeak". No OperatingSystem check: "espeak" is
    # for Linux but is also an optional package for BSD.
    IO.popen(["espeak", "-stdin"], "w") {|pipe| pipe.puts text}
  end
end

speak 'This is an example of speech synthesis.'
```



## Scala

## Sidef


```ruby

## Swift

OS X comes with a program called "say," that does speech.

```Swift
import Foundation

let task = NSTask()
task.launchPath = "/usr/bin/say"
task.arguments = ["This is an example of speech synthesis."]
task.launch()
```



## Tcl

This just passes the string into the Festival system:

```tcl
exec festival --tts << "This is an example of speech synthesis."
```

Alternatively, on MacOS X, you'd use the system <code>say</code> program:

```tcl
exec say << "This is an example of speech synthesis."
```

On Windows, there is a service available by COM for speech synthesis:
```tcl
package require tcom

set msg "This is an example of speech synthesis."
set voice [::tcom::ref createobject Sapi.SpVoice]
$voice Speak $msg 0
```

Putting these together into a helper procedure, we get:

```tcl
proc speak {msg} {
    global tcl_platform
    if {$tcl_platform(platform) eq "windows"} {
        package require tcom
        set voice [::tcom::ref createobject Sapi.SpVoice]
        $voice Speak $msg 0
    } elseif {$tcl_platform(os) eq "Darwin"} {
        exec say << $msg
    } else {
        exec festival --tts << $msg
    }
}
speak "This is an example of speech synthesis."
```
