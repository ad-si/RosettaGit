{{task|Cards}} [[Category:Puzzles]]
Set Puzzles are created with a deck of cards from the [[wp:Set (game)|Set Gameâ„¢]]. The object of the puzzle is to find sets of 3 cards in a rectangle of cards that have been dealt face up.


There are 81 cards in a deck.
Each card contains a unique variation of the following four features: ''color, symbol, number and shading''.

* there are three colors:
    ''red, green, purple''



* there are three symbols:
    ''oval, squiggle, diamond''



* there is a number of symbols on the card:
    ''one, two, three''



* there are three shadings:
    ''solid, open, striped''



Three cards form a ''set'' if each feature is either the same on each card, or is different on each card. For instance: all 3 cards are red, all 3 cards have a different symbol, all 3 cards have a different number of symbols, all 3 cards are striped.

There are two degrees of difficulty: [http://www.setgame.com/set/rules_basic.htm ''basic''] and [http://www.setgame.com/set/rules_advanced.htm ''advanced'']. The basic mode deals 9 cards, that contain exactly 4 sets; the advanced mode deals 12 cards that contain exactly 6 sets.

When creating sets you may use the same card more than once.




## Task

Write code that deals the cards (9 or 12, depending on selected mode) from a shuffled deck in which the total number of sets that could be found is 4 (or 6, respectively); and print the contents of the cards and the sets.

For instance:



'''DEALT 9 CARDS:'''

:green, one, oval, striped

:green, one, diamond, open

:green, one, diamond, striped

:green, one, diamond, solid

:purple, one, diamond, open

:purple, two, squiggle, open

:purple, three, oval, open

:red, three, oval, open

:red, three, diamond, solid


'''CONTAINING 4 SETS:'''

:green, one, oval, striped

:purple, two, squiggle, open

:red, three, diamond, solid


:green, one, diamond, open

:green, one, diamond, striped

:green, one, diamond, solid


:green, one, diamond, open

:purple, two, squiggle, open

:red, three, oval, open


:purple, one, diamond, open

:purple, two, squiggle, open

:purple, three, oval, open





## Ada


We start with the specification of a package "Set_Puzzle.


```Ada
package Set_Puzzle is

   type Three is range 1..3;
   type Card is array(1 .. 4) of Three;
   type Cards is array(Positive range <>) of Card;
   type Set is array(Three) of Positive;

   procedure Deal_Cards(Dealt: out Cards);
   -- ouputs an array with disjoint cards

   function To_String(C: Card) return String;

   generic
      with procedure Do_something(C: Cards; S: Set);
   procedure Find_Sets(Given: Cards);
   -- calls Do_Something once for each set it finds.

end Set_Puzzle;
```


Now we implement the package "Set_Puzzle".


```Ada
with Ada.Numerics.Discrete_Random;

package body Set_Puzzle is

   package Rand is new Ada.Numerics.Discrete_Random(Three);
   R: Rand.Generator;

   function Locate(Some: Cards; C: Card) return Natural is
      -- returns index of card C in Some, or 0 if not found
   begin
      for I in Some'Range loop
	 if C = Some(I) then
	    return I;
	 end if;
      end loop;
      return 0;
   end Locate;

   procedure Deal_Cards(Dealt: out Cards) is
      function Random_Card return Card is
	 (Rand.Random(R), Rand.Random(R), Rand.Random(R), Rand.Random(R));
   begin
      for I in Dealt'Range loop
	 -- draw a random card until different from all card previously drawn
	 Dealt(I) := Random_Card; -- draw random card
	 while Locate(Dealt(Dealt'First .. I-1), Dealt(I)) /= 0 loop
	    -- Dealt(I) has been drawn before
	    Dealt(I) := Random_Card; -- draw another random card
	 end loop;
      end loop;
   end Deal_Cards;

   procedure Find_Sets(Given: Cards) is
      function To_Set(A, B: Card) return Card is
	 -- returns the unique card C, which would make a set with A and B
	 C: Card;
      begin
	 for I in 1 .. 4 loop
	    if A(I) = B(I) then
	       C(I) := A(I); -- all three the same
	    else
	       C(I) := 6 - A(I) - B(I); -- all three different;
	    end if;
	 end loop;
	 return C;
      end To_Set;

      X: Natural;

   begin
      for I in Given'Range loop
	 for J in Given'First .. I-1 loop
	    X := Locate(Given, To_Set(Given(I), Given(J)));
	    if I < X then -- X=0 is no set, 0 < X < I is a duplicate
	      Do_Something(Given, (J, I, X));
	    end if;
	 end loop;
      end loop;
   end Find_Sets;

   function To_String(C: Card) return String is

      Col: constant array(Three) of String(1..6)
	:= ("Red   ", "Green ", "Purple");
      Sym: constant array(Three) of String(1..8)
	:= ("Oval    ", "Squiggle", "Diamond ");
      Num: constant array(Three) of String(1..5)
	:= ("One  ", "Two  ", "Three");
      Sha: constant array(Three) of String(1..7)
	:= ("Solid  ", "Open   ", "Striped");

   begin
      return (Col(C(1)) & " " & Sym(C(2)) & " " & Num(C(3)) & " " & Sha(C(4)));
   end To_String;

begin
   Rand.Reset(R);
end Set_Puzzle;
```


Finally, we write the main program, using the above package. It reads two parameters from the command line. The first parameter describes the number of cards, the second one the number of sets. Thus, for the basic mode one has to call "puzzle 9 4", for the advanced mode "puzzle 12 6", but the program would support any other combination of parameters just as well.


```Ada
with Ada.Text_IO, Set_Puzzle, Ada.Command_Line;

procedure Puzzle is

   package TIO renames Ada.Text_IO;

   Card_Count:     Positive := Positive'Value(Ada.Command_Line.Argument(1));
   Required_Sets:  Positive := Positive'Value(Ada.Command_Line.Argument(2));

   Cards: Set_Puzzle.Cards(1 .. Card_Count);

   function Cnt_Sets(C: Set_Puzzle.Cards) return Natural is
      Cnt: Natural := 0;
      procedure Count_Sets(C: Set_Puzzle.Cards; S: Set_Puzzle.Set) is
      begin
         Cnt := Cnt + 1;
      end Count_Sets;
      procedure CS is new Set_Puzzle.Find_Sets(Count_Sets);
   begin
      CS(C);
      return Cnt;
   end Cnt_Sets;

   procedure Print_Sets(C: Set_Puzzle.Cards) is
      procedure Print_A_Set(C: Set_Puzzle.Cards; S: Set_Puzzle.Set) is
      begin
         TIO.Put("(" & Integer'Image(S(1)) & "," & Integer'Image(S(2))
                   & "," & Integer'Image(S(3)) & " )  ");
      end Print_A_Set;
      procedure PS is new Set_Puzzle.Find_Sets(Print_A_Set);
   begin
      PS(C);
      TIO.New_Line;
   end Print_Sets;

begin
   loop    -- deal random cards
      Set_Puzzle.Deal_Cards(Cards);
      exit when Cnt_Sets(Cards) = Required_Sets;
   end loop;    -- until number of sets is as required

   for I in Cards'Range loop    -- print the cards
      if I < 10 then
         TIO.Put(" ");
      end if;
      TIO.Put_Line(Integer'Image(I) & " " & Set_Puzzle.To_String(Cards(I)));
   end loop;

   Print_Sets(Cards);    -- print the sets
end Puzzle;
```

## C

Brute force. Each card is a unique number in the range of [0,81].  Randomly deal a hand of cards until exactly the required number of sets are found.

## Mathematica

A simple brute force approach. This code highlights two things: 1) a few of Mathematica's "higher-level" functions such as Tuples and Subsets and 2) the straightforwardness enabled by the language's "dynamic typing" (more precisely, its symbolic semantics) and its usage of lists for everything (in this particular example, the fact that functions such as Tuples and Entropy can be used on lists with arbitrary content).

## Perl

It's actually slightly simplified, since generating Enum classes
and objects would be overkill for this particular task.

```perl
#!perl
use strict;
use warnings;

# This code was adapted from the perl6 solution for this task.

# Each element of the deck is an integer, which, when written
# in octal, has four digits, which are all either 1, 2, or 4.

my $fmt = '%4o';
my @deck = grep sprintf($fmt, $_) !~ tr/124//c, 01111 .. 04444;

# Given a feature digit (1, 2, or 4), produce the feature's name.
# Note that digits 0 and 3 are unused.
my @features = map [split ' '], split /\n/,<<'';
! red   green    ! purple
! one   two      ! three
! oval  squiggle ! diamond
! solid open     ! striped

81 == @deck or die "There are ".@deck." cards (should be 81)";

# By default, draw 9 cards, but if the user
# supplied a parameter, use that.
my $draw = shift(@ARGV) || 9;
my $goal = int($draw/2);

# Get the possible combinations of 3 indices into $draw elements.
my @combinations = combine(3, 0 .. $draw-1);

my @sets;

do {
	# Shuffle the first $draw elements of @deck.
	for my $i ( 0 .. $draw-1 ) {
		my $j = $i + int rand(@deck - $i);
		@deck[$i, $j] = @deck[$j, $i];
	}

	# Find all valid sets using the shuffled elements.
	@sets = grep {
		my $or = 0;
		$or |= $_ for @deck[@$_];
		# If all colors (or whatever) are the same, then
		# a 1, 2, or 4 will result when we OR them together.
		# If they're all different, then a 7 will result.
		# If any other digit occurs, the set is invalid.
		sprintf($fmt, $or) !~ tr/1247//c;
	} @combinations;

	# Continue until there are exactly $goal valid sets.
} until @sets == $goal;

print "Drew $draw cards:\n";
for my $i ( 0 .. $#sets ) {
	print "Set ", $i+1, ":\n";
	my @cards = @deck[ @{$sets[$i]} ];
	for my $card ( @cards ) {
		my @octal = split //, sprintf '%4o', $card;
		my @f = map $features[$_][$octal[$_]], 0 .. 3;

	}
}

## Perl 6

The trick here is to allocate three different bits for each enum, with the result that the cards of a matching set OR together to produce a 4-digit octal number that contains only the digits 1, 2, 4, or 7.  This OR is done by funny looking <tt>[+|]</tt>, which is the reduction form of <tt>+|</tt>, which is the numeric bitwise OR.  (Because Perl 6 stole the bare <tt>|</tt> operator for composing junctions instead.)

```perl6
enum Color (red => 0o1000, green =>  0o2000, purple => 0o4000);
enum Count (one =>  0o100, two =>     0o200, three =>   0o400);
enum Shape (oval =>  0o10, squiggle => 0o20, diamond =>  0o40);
enum Style (solid =>  0o1, open =>      0o2, striped =>   0o4);

my @deck = Color.enums X Count.enums X Shape.enums X Style.enums;

sub MAIN($DRAW = 9, $GOAL = $DRAW div 2) {
    sub show-cards(@c) { { printf "%9s%7s%10s%9s\n", @c[$_;*]Â».key } for ^@c }

    my @combinations = [^$DRAW].combinations(3);

    my @draw;
    repeat until (my @sets) == $GOAL {
        @draw = @deck.pick($DRAW);
        my @bits = @draw.map: { [+] @^enumsÂ».value }
        @sets = gather for @combinations -> @c {
            take @draw[@c].item when /^ <[1247]>+ $/ given ( [+|] @bits[@c] ).base(8);
        }
    }

    say "Drew $DRAW cards:";
    show-cards @draw;
    for @sets.kv -> $i, @cards {
        say "\nSet {$i+1}:";
        show-cards @cards;

## REXX

Language note:   each REXX implementation has its own method of determining a starter ''seed'' for generating

pseudo-random numbers, and in addition, that starter seed may be dependent upon operating system factors,

hardware architecture, and other things like the (local) date and time-of-day, and other such variables.

The algorithm is also not the same for all REXX implementations.

The particular set of cards dealt (show below) used Regina 3.90 under a Windows/XP environment.

## Tcl

The principle behind this code is that the space of possible solutions is a substantial proportion of the space of possible hands, so picking a random hand and verifying that it is a solution, repeating until that verification succeeds, is a much quicker way to find a solution than a systematic search.
It also makes the code substantially simpler.

```tcl
# Generate random integer uniformly on range [0..$n-1]
proc random n {expr {int(rand() * $n)}}

# Generate a shuffled deck of all cards; the card encoding was stolen from the
# Perl6 solution. This is done once and then used as a constant. Note that the
# rest of the code assumes that all cards in the deck are unique.
