## Task

Three dogs (Are there three dogs or one dog?) is a code snippet used to illustrate the lettercase sensitivity of the programming language. For a case-sensitive language, the identifiers dog, Dog and DOG are all different and we should get the output:

```txt

The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.

```

For a language that is lettercase insensitive, we get the following output:

```txt

There is just one dog named Bernie.

```

## 11l

11l identifiers are case sensitive.

```11l
V dog = ‘Benjamin’
V Dog = ‘Samba’
V DOG = ‘Bernie’
print(‘The three dogs are named ’dog‘, ’Dog‘ and ’DOG‘.’)
```



## Ada

case insensitive

```Ada
with Ada.Text_IO;
procedure Dogs is
   Dog : String := "Bernie";
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("There is just one dog named " & DOG);
end Dogs;
```


Output:

```txt
There is just one dog named Bernie
```



## Agena

Translation of Algol W. Agena is case sensitive, as this example demonstrates. Tested with Agena 2.9.5 Win32

```agena
scope
    local dog := "Benjamin";
    scope
        local Dog := "Samba";
        scope
            local DOG := "Bernie";
            if DOG <> Dog or DOG <> dog
            then print( "The three dogs are named: " & dog & ", " & Dog & " and " & DOG )
            else print( "There is just one dog named: " & DOG )
            fi
        epocs
    epocs

## Aime


```aime
text dog, Dog, DOG;

dog = "Benjamin";
Dog = "Samba";
DOG = "Bernie";

o_form("The three dogs are named ~, ~ and ~.\n", dog, Dog, DOG);
```



## ALGOL 68

A joke code entry... :-) ¢ but the code does actually work!
'''File: Case-sensitivity_of_identifiers.a68'''
```algol68
#!/usr/bin/a68g --script #
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*- #

STRING dog = "Benjamin";
OP D = (INT og)STRING: "Samba";
OP DOG = (INT gy)STRING: "Bernie";
INT og=~, gy=~;

main:(
  printf(($"The three dogs are named "g", "g" and "g"."l$, dog, Dog, DOGgy));
  0
)
```
'''Output:'''

```txt

The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.

```


Alternative version.


Most recent implementations of Algol 68 use "upper stropping", the "keywords" are in upper case and the identifiers are an lower case. This precludes use of e.g. Dog or DOG as the name of a variable or constant.


However, depending on the "stropping" convention used and the implementation, Algol 68 can be case-sensitive. Rutgers ALGOL 68 uses quote stropping and allows both upper and lower case in identifiers and bold words. The standard bold words must be in lower-case.

```algol68
'begin'
    'string' dog = "Benjamin";
    'begin'
        'string' Dog = "Samba";
        'begin'
            'string' DOG = "Bernie";
            'if' DOG /= Dog 'or' DOG /= dog
            'then' print( ( "The three dogs are named: ", dog, ", ", Dog, " and ", DOG ) )
            'else' print( ( "There is just one dog named: ", DOG ) )
            'fi'
        'end'
    'end'
'end'
```


```txt

The three dogs are named: Benjamin, Samba and Bernie

```



## ALGOL W

Algol W identifiers are not case-sensitive but variable names in inner blocks can be the same as those in outer blocks...

```algolw
begin
    string(8) dog;
    dog := "Benjamin";
    begin
        string(8) Dog;
        Dog := "Samba";
        begin
            string(8) DOG;
            DOG := "Bernie";
            if DOG not = Dog
            or DOG not = dog
            then write( "The three dogs are named: ", dog, ", ", Dog, " and ", DOG )
            else write( "There is just one dog named: ", DOG )
        end
    end
end.
```

```txt

There is just one dog named: Bernie

```



## APL


```apl
      DOG←'Benjamin'
      Dog←'Samba'
      dog←'Bernie'
      'The three dogs are named ',DOG,', ',Dog,', and ',dog
The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba, and Bernie
```



## AutoHotkey


```AutoHotkey
dog := "Benjamin"
Dog := "Samba"
DOG := "Bernie"
MsgBox There is just one dog named %dOG%
```



## AWK


```awk
BEGIN {
	dog = "Benjamin"
	Dog = "Samba"
	DOG = "Bernie"
	printf "The three dogs are named %s, %s and %s.\n", dog, Dog, DOG
}
```


The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.


## Batch File


```dos

@echo off

set dog=Benjamin
set Dog=Samba
set DOG=Bernie

echo There is just one dog named %dog%.
pause>nul

```

```txt

```



## BBC BASIC


```bbcbasic
      dog$ = "Benjamin"
      Dog$ = "Samba"
      DOG$ = "Bernie"
      PRINT "The three dogs are " dog$ ", " Dog$ " and " DOG$ "."
```

Output:

```txt
The three dogs are Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.
```



## bc

The only variables are 'a' through 'z'. They can only hold numbers, not strings. Some implementations allow longer names like 'dog', but only with lowercase letters. A name like 'Dog' or 'DOG' is a syntax error.


```bc
obase = 16
ibase = 16

/*
 * Store the hexadecimal number 'BE27A312'
 * in the variable 'd'.
 */
d = BE27A312
"There is just one dog named "; d
quit
```


There is just one dog named BE27A312


## Bracmat


```Bracmat
( Benjamin:?dog
& Samba:?Dog
& Bernie:?DOG
& out$("There are three dogs:" !dog !Dog and !DOG)
);
```

Output:

```txt
There are three dogs: Benjamin Samba and Bernie
```



## Brlcad


The three dogs are drawn as spheres in this simple example:


```mged

opendb dogs.g y            # Create a database to hold our dogs
units ft                   # The dogs are measured in feet
in dog.s sph 0 0 0 1       # Benjie is a little Scottie dog
in Dog.s sph 4 0 0 3       # Samba is a Labrador
in DOG.s sph 13 0 0 5      # Bernie is massive. He is a New Foundland
echo The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie
```



## C

C is case sensitive; if it would be case insensitive, an error about redefinition of a variable would be raised.


```c
#include <stdio.h>

static const char *dog = "Benjamin";
static const char *Dog = "Samba";
static const char *DOG = "Bernie";

int main()
{
    printf("The three dogs are named %s, %s and %s.\n", dog, Dog, DOG);
    return 0;
}
```



## C++

C++ is case-sensitive.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string dog = "Benjamin", Dog = "Samba", DOG = "Bernie";

    cout << "The three dogs are named " << dog << ", " << Dog << ", and " << DOG << endl;
}
```

```txt
The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba, and Bernie
```



## C#

C# is case sensitive

```C sharp

using System;

class Program

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string dog = "Benjamin";
        string Dog = "Samba";

        Console.WriteLine(string.Format("The three dogs are named {0}, {1}, and {2}.", dog, Dog, DOG));
    }
}
```



## Clojure


```txt

## Common Lisp


```lisp

	   (format nil "There is just one dog named ~a." dog))
; in: LAMBDA NIL

```


These are the style warnings from [[SBCL]]. Other implementations of Common Lisp might give different warnings.


## D


```d
import std.stdio;

void main() {
    string dog = "Benjamin";
    // identifiers that start with capital letters are type names
    string Dog = "Samba";
    string DOG = "Bernie";
    writefln("There are three dogs named ",
             dog, ", ", Dog, ", and ", DOG, "'");
}
```

Output:

```txt
There are three dogs named Benjamin, Samba, and Bernie'
```



## dc

A register name has only one character, so this example uses 'd' and 'D'.


```dc
[Benjamin]sd
[Samba]sD
[The two dogs are named ]P ldP [ and ]P lDP [.
]P
```


```txt
The two dogs are named Benjamin and Samba.
```



## Delphi

Delphi is case insensitive.


```Delphi
program CaseSensitiveIdentifiers;

{$APPTYPE CONSOLE}

var
  dog: string;
begin
  dog := 'Benjamin';
  Dog := 'Samba';
  DOG := 'Bernie';
  Writeln('There is just one dog named ' + dog);
end.
```


Output:

```txt
There is just one dog named Bernie
```


=={{header|Déjà Vu}}==

```dejavu
local :dog "Benjamin"
local :Dog "Samba"
local :DOG "Bernie"

!print( "There are three dogs named " dog ", " Dog " and " DOG "." )
```

```txt
There are three dogs named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.
```



## DWScript


```Delphi

var dog : String;

dog := 'Benjamin';
Dog := 'Samba';
DOG := 'Bernie';

PrintLn('There is just one dog named ' + dog);
```


Output:

```txt
There is just one dog named Bernie
```



## EchoLisp


```scheme

(define dog "Benjamin")
(define Dog "Samba")
(define DOG "Bernie")

(printf "The three dogs are named %a, %a and %a. " dog Dog DOG)
    The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.

```


## Elena

In ELENA identifiers are case sensitive.
ELENA 4.x:

```elena
import extensions;

public program()
{
    var dog := "Benjamin";
    var Dog := "Samba";
    var DOG := "Bernie";
    console.printLineFormatted("The three dogs are named {0}, {1} and {2}", dog, Dog, DOG)
}
```

```txt

The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie

```



## Elixir

While Elixir's identifiers are case-sensitive, they generally must start with a lowercase letter. Capitalized identifiers are reserved for modules.

```elixir
dog = "Benjamin"
doG = "Samba"
dOG = "Bernie"
IO.puts "The three dogs are named #{dog}, #{doG} and #{dOG}."
```


```txt

The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.

```



## Erlang

Erlang variables are case sensitive but must start with an uppercase letter.

```Erlang

-module( case_sensitivity_of_identifiers ).

-export( [task/0] ).

task() ->
	catch dog = "Benjamin", % Function will crash without catch
	Dog = "Samba",
	DOG = "Bernie",
	io:fwrite( "The three dogs are named ~s, ~s and ~s~n", [dog, Dog, DOG] ).

```


```txt

4> case_sensitivity_of_identifiers:task().
The three dogs are named dog, Samba and Bernie

```



## Euphoria

```Euphoria
-- These variables are all different
sequence dog = "Benjamin"
sequence Dog = "Samba"
sequence DOG = "Bernie"
printf( 1, "The three dogs are named %s, %s and %s\n", {dog, Dog, DOG} )
```



## Factor

Factor identifiers are case-sensitive.

```factor
USING: formatting locals ;
IN: scratchpad
[let
    "Benjamin" :> dog
    "Samba"    :> Dog
    "Bernie"   :> DOG
    { dog Dog DOG } "There are three dogs named %s, %s, and %s." vprintf
]
```

```txt

There are three dogs named Benjamin, Samba, and Bernie.

```



## Forth


```forth
: DOG ." Benjamin" ;
: Dog ." Samba" ;
: dog ." Bernie" ;
: HOWMANYDOGS ." There is just one dog named " DOG ;
HOWMANYDOGS
```

```txt
There is just one dog named Bernie
```



## Fortran

Fortran is case insensitive, and so the three "dog" variants name the same variable - which therefore is multiply declared and will likely evoke a compiler complaint.

```fortran
program Example
  implicit none

  character(8) :: dog, Dog, DOG

  dog = "Benjamin"
  Dog = "Samba"
  DOG = "Bernie"

  if (dog == DOG) then
    write(*,*) "There is just one dog named ", dog
  else
    write(*,*) "The three dogs are named ", dog, Dog, " and ", DOG
  end if

end program Example
```

Output:

```txt
 There is just one dog named Bernie
```



## FreeBASIC


```freebasic
' FB 1.05.0 Win64

' FreeBASIC is case-insensitive
Dim dog As String
dog = "Benjamin"
Dog = "Samba"
DOG = "Bernie"
Print "There is just one dog, named "; dog
Sleep
```


```txt

There is just one dog, named Bernie

```



## Frink

Frink is case-sensitive.

```frink
dog = "Benjamin"
Dog = "Samba"
DOG = "Bernie"
println["There are three dogs named $dog, $Dog and $DOG"]
```


=={{header|F Sharp|F#}}==
F# is case-sensitive.

```fsharp
let dog = "Benjamin"
let Dog = "Samba"
let DOG = "Bernie"
printfn "There are three dogs named %s, %s and %s" dog Dog DOG
```

	DOG := "Bernie";
	if dog = DOG then

	else
		Print("The three dogs are named ", dog, ", ", Dog, " and ", DOG, "\n");
	fi;
end;

ThreeDogs();
# The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie
```



## Go

Go is case sensitive.  Further, visibility depends on case. See the Go entry under the [[Scope_modifiers#Go|Scope modifiers]] task.

```go
package dogs

import "fmt"

// Three variables, three different names.
// (It wouldn't compile if the compiler saw the variable names as the same.)
var dog = "Salt"
var Dog = "Pepper"
var DOG = "Mustard"

func PackageSees() map[*string]int {
    // Print dogs visible from here.
    fmt.Println("Package sees:", dog, Dog, DOG)
    // Return addresses of the variables visible from here.
    // The point of putting them in a map is that maps store only
    // unique keys, so it will end up with three items only if
    // the variables really represent different places in memory.
    return map[*string]int{&dog: 1, &Dog: 1, &DOG: 1}
}
```


```go
package main

import (
    . "dogs"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    // with the dogs package imported, there are three dogs.
    d := PackageSees()
    fmt.Println("There are", len(d), "dogs.\n")

    // Declaration of new variable dog.  It lives in this package, main.
    dog := "Benjamin"
    d = PackageSees()
    fmt.Println("Main sees:   ", dog, Dog, DOG)
    // Four dogs now.  two of the three visible from here are the
    // the same as ones in the dogs package.
    d[&dog] = 1
    d[&Dog] = 1
    d[&DOG] = 1
    fmt.Println("There are", len(d), "dogs.\n")

    // Not a declaration, just an assigment.  This assigns a new value to
    // the variable Dog declared in the package.  Dog is visible because
    // it begins with an upper case letter.
    Dog = "Samba"
    // same four dogs, same three visible, one just has a new name.
    d = PackageSees()
    fmt.Println("Main sees:   ", dog, Dog, DOG)
    d[&dog] = 1
    d[&Dog] = 1
    d[&DOG] = 1
    fmt.Println("There are", len(d), "dogs.\n")

    // Of course you can still declare a variable if you want to.  This
    // declares a new variable, shadowing DOG in the package and rendering
    // it inaccessable even though it begins with an upper case letter.
    var DOG = "Bernie"
    // five dogs now.  three visible from here.
    d = PackageSees()
    fmt.Println("Main sees:   ", dog, Dog, DOG)
    d[&dog] = 1
    d[&Dog] = 1
    d[&DOG] = 1
    fmt.Println("There are", len(d), "dogs.")
}
```

```txt

Package sees: Salt Pepper Mustard
There are 3 dogs.

Package sees: Salt Pepper Mustard
Main sees:    Benjamin Pepper Mustard
There are 4 dogs.

Package sees: Salt Samba Mustard
Main sees:    Benjamin Samba Mustard
There are 4 dogs.

Package sees: Salt Samba Mustard
Main sees:    Benjamin Samba Bernie
There are 5 dogs.

```



## Groovy

Solution:

```groovy
def dog = "Benjamin", Dog = "Samba", DOG = "Bernie"
println (dog == DOG ? "There is one dog named ${dog}" : "There are three dogs named ${dog}, ${Dog} and ${DOG}.")
```


Output:

```txt
There are three dogs named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.
```



## Haskell

Identifiers are case sensitive in Haskell, but must start with a lower case letter.


```Haskell
import Text.Printf

main = printf "The three dogs are named %s, %s and %s.\n" dog dOG dOg
    where dog = "Benjamin"
          dOG = "Samba"
          dOg = "Bernie"
```


=={{header|Icon}} and {{header|Unicon}}==
The program below demonstrates the three dog task.  All variants of Icon/Unicon have case sensitive variable names. But if one wasn't this would find it.

```Icon
procedure main()

   dog := "Benjamin"
   Dog := "Samba"
   DOG := "Bernie"

   if dog == DOG then
      write("There is just one dog named ", dog,".")
   else
      write("The three dogs are named ", dog, ", ", Dog, " and ", DOG, ".")

end
```



## J


```j
   NB. These variables are all different
   dog=: 'Benjamin'
   Dog=: 'Samba'
   DOG=: 'Bernie'
   'The three dogs are named ',dog,', ',Dog,', and ',DOG
The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba, and Bernie
```



## Java


```java
String dog = "Benjamin";
String Dog = "Samba"; //in general, identifiers that start with capital letters are class names
String DOG = "Bernie"; //in general, identifiers in all caps are constants
//the conventions listed in comments here are not enforced by the language
System.out.println("There are three dogs named " + dog + ", " + Dog + ", and " + DOG + "'");
```



## JavaScript

Javascript is case sensitive.

```javascript
var dog = "Benjamin";
var Dog = "Samba";
var DOG = "Bernie";
document.write("The three dogs are named " + dog + ", " + Dog + ", and " + DOG + ".");
```



## jq

jq identifiers are case-sensitive.

'''Function parameters''':

```jq
def task(dog; Dog; DOG):
 "The three dogs are named \(dog), \(Dog), and \(DOG)." ;

task("Benjamin"; "Samba"; "Bernie")
```


 $ jq -n -f Case-sensitivity.jq
 "The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba, and Bernie."

'''Variable names''':

```jq
"Benjamin" as $dog | "Samba" as $Dog | "Bernie" as $DOG
 | "The three dogs are named \($dog), \($Dog), and \($DOG)."
```

As above.


## Julia

Variable names are case sensitive.

```julia
dog, Dog, DOG = "Benjamin", "Samba", "Bernie"

if dog === Dog
    println("There is only one dog, ", DOG)
else
    println("The three dogs are:  ", dog, ", ", Dog, " and ", DOG)
end
```


```txt
The three dogs are:  Benjamin, Samba and Bernie
```


Conventionally, variable names should be all lower case.  Type and Macro names should be capitalized.


## K


```k

  dog: "Benjamin"
  Dog: "Samba"
  DOG: "Bernie"
  "There are three dogs named ",dog,", ",Dog," and ",DOG
"There are three dogs named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie"

```



## Kotlin

Kotlin is case-sensitive though (as in Java) the convention is for local variable names to begin with a lower case letter. The second and third identifiers would therefore be unlikely to be used in practice.

```scala
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val dog = "Benjamin"
    val Dog = "Samba"
    val DOG = "Bernie"

```


```txt

```



## Lasso

Lasso is not case sensitive for names

```Lasso

local(dog = 'Benjamin')
local(Dog = 'Samba')
local(DOG = 'Bernie')

stdoutnl('There is just one dog named ' + #dog)

```

Output:

```txt
There is just one dog named Bernie
```


Same with string comparisons. (Lasso maps can only contain unique keys)

```Lasso

local(dogs = map(
	'dog' = 'Benjamin',
	'Dog' = 'Samba',
	'DOG' = 'Bernie'
))
stdoutnl(#dogs -> size)
```

Output:

```txt
1
```


To get case sensitivity we need to use bytes

```Lasso

local(dogs = map(
	bytes('dog') = 'Benjamin',
	bytes('Dog') = 'Samba',
	bytes('DOG') = 'Bernie'
))

stdoutnl(#dogs -> size)

stdoutnl(#dogs -> find(bytes('Dog')))
```

Output:

```txt
3
Samba
```



## Liberty BASIC

NB the IDE warns you that there are similar variables named dog$, Dog$ & DOG$

```lb

dog$ = "Benjamin"
Dog$ = "Samba"
DOG$ = "Bernie"
print "The three dogs are "; dog$; ", "; Dog$; " and "; DOG$; "."

end

```

The three dogs are Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.

## OCaml


Identifiers in OCaml are lettercase sensitive, but the first letter has to be lowercase.


```ocaml

## Perl


```perl
# These variables are all different
$dog='Benjamin';
$Dog='Samba';
$DOG='Bernie';
print "The three dogs are named $dog, $Dog, and $DOG \n"
```



## Perl 6


```perl6
my $dog = 'Benjamin';
my $Dog = 'Samba';
my $DOG = 'Bernie';
say "The three dogs are named $dog, $Dog, and $DOG."
```

The only place that Perl�pays any attention to the case of identifiers is that, for certain error messages, it will guess that an identifier starting lowercase is probably a function name, while one starting uppercase is probably a type or constant name.  But this case distinction is merely a convention in Perl, not mandatory:

```perl6
constant dog = 'Benjamin';
sub Dog() { 'Samba' }
my &DOG = { 'Bernie' }
say "The three dogs are named {dog}, {Dog}, and {DOG}."
```



## Phix

## Prolog

In Prolog, the initial of a variable must be a uppercase letter. So the task can't be completed but we can write this code :

```Prolog
three_dogs :-
	DoG = 'Benjamin',
	Dog = 'Samba',
	DOG = 'Bernie',
	format('The three dogs are named ~w, ~w and ~w.~n', [DoG, Dog, DOG]).

```

The output is :

```txt
?- three_dogs.
The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.
true.


```


## PureBasic


```PureBasic

## Python

Python names are case sensitive:

```python>>>
 dog = 'Benjamin'; Dog = 'Samba'; DOG = 'Bernie'
>>> print ('The three dogs are named ',dog,', ',Dog,', and ',DOG)
The three dogs are named  Benjamin ,  Samba , and  Bernie
>>>
```



## R


```R
dog <- 'Benjamin'
Dog <- 'Samba'
DOG <- 'Bernie'

# Having fun with cats and dogs
cat('The three dogs are named ')
cat(dog)
cat(', ')
cat(Dog)
cat(' and ')
cat(DOG)
cat('.\n')
# In one line it would be:
# cat('The three dogs are named ', dog, ', ', Dog, ' and ', DOG, '.\n', sep = '')
```


Output:

```txt

The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.

```



## Racket

The default setting for the Racket reader is to be case sensitive:

```Racket

#lang racket
(define dog "Benjamin")
(define Dog "Samba")
(define DOG "Bernie")

(if (equal? dog DOG)
    (displayln (~a "There is one dog named " DOG "."))
    (displayln (~a "The three dogs are named " dog ", " Dog ", and, " DOG ".")))

```

Output:

```txt

The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba, and, Bernie.

```


If you need case insensitive identifiers, then use #ci to turn on case insensitivity:

```Racket

#lang racket
#ci(module dogs racket
     (define dog "Benjamin")
     (set! Dog "Samba")
     (set! DOG "Bernie")
     (if (equal? dog DOG)
         (displayln (~a "There is one dog named " DOG "."))
         (displayln (~a "The three dogs are named " dog ", " Dog ", and, " DOG "."))))
(require 'dogs)

```

Output:

```txt

There is one dog named Bernie.

```



## Retro

Retro is case sensitive.


```Retro

## REXX


### simple variables

The REXX language is case insensitive   (with respect to simple variables).

```rexx
/*REXX program demonstrate  case insensitivity  for  simple  REXX  variable names.      */

  /*  ┌──◄── all 3 left─hand side REXX variables are identical (as far as assignments). */
  /*  │                                                                                 */
  /*  ↓                                                                                 */
     dog= 'Benjamin'                             /*assign a   lowercase   variable (dog)*/
     Dog= 'Samba'                                /*   "   "  capitalized     "      Dog */
     DOG= 'Bernie'                               /*   "   an  uppercase      "      DOG */

                              say center('using simple variables', 35, "─")     /*title.*/
                              say

                          else say 'There is just one dog named:'  dog"."

                                                 /*stick a fork in it,  we're all done. */
```

'''output'''

### compound variables

However, the REXX language is case sensitive   (with respect to compound variables, or indices).

```rexx
/*REXX program demonstrate case sensitive REXX  index  names  (for compound variables). */

 /*  ┌──◄── all 3 indices (for an array variable)  are unique  (as far as array index). */
 /*  │                                                                                  */
 /*  ↓                                                                                  */
x= 'dog';  dogname.x= "Gunner"                   /*assign an array index,  lowercase dog*/
x= 'Dog';  dogname.x= "Thor"                     /*   "    "   "     "   capitalized Dog*/
x= 'DOG';  dogname.x= "Jax"                      /*   "    "   "     "     uppercase DOG*/
x= 'doG';  dogname.x= "Rex"                      /*   "    "   "     "       mixed   doG*/

                              say center('using compound variables', 35, "═")   /*title.*/
                              say

## Ring


```ring

doG = "Smokey"
Dog = "Samba"
DOG = "Bernie"
see "The 4 dogs are : " + dog +  ", " + doG + ", " + Dog + " and " + DOG + "."

```



## Ruby

Ruby gives a special meaning to the first letter of a name. A lowercase letter starts a local variable. An uppercase letter starts a constant. So <tt>dog</tt> is a local variable, but <tt>Dog</tt> and <tt>DOG</tt> are constants. To adapt this task to Ruby, I added <tt>dOg</tt> and <tt>doG</tt> so that I have more than one local variable.


```ruby
module FiveDogs
  dog = "Benjamin"
  dOg = "Dogley"
  doG = "Fido"
  Dog = "Samba"   # this constant is FiveDogs::Dog
  DOG = "Bernie"  # this constant is FiveDogs::DOG

  names = [dog, dOg, doG, Dog, DOG]
  names.uniq!
  puts "There are %d dogs named %s." % [names.length, names.join(", ")]
  puts
  puts "The local variables are %s." % local_variables.join(", ")
  puts "The constants are %s." % constants.join(", ")
end
```


Output:
```txt
There are 5 dogs named Benjamin, Dogley, Fido, Samba, Bernie.

The local variables are dog, dOg, doG, names.
The constants are Dog, DOG.
```



## Rust

Rust style dictates that identifiers should be written in snake case, e.g. <tt>big_dog</tt>, <tt>small_dog</tt>; whereas types (structs and enums) should be written in camel case, e.g. <tt>BigDog</tt>, <tt>SmallDog</tt>. Failing to comply with this standard does not cause a compiler error, but it will trigger a compiler warning, and the culture is very strongly towards compliance with this standard.


```rust
fn main() {
    let dog = "Benjamin";
    let Dog = "Samba";
    let DOG = "Bernie";
    println!("The three dogs are named {}, {} and {}.", dog, Dog, DOG);
}
```


This triggers two warnings at compilation:

<lang><anon>:3:9: 3:12 warning: variable `Dog` should have a snake case name such as `dog`, #[warn(non_snake_case)] on by default
<anon>:3     let Dog = "Samba";
                 ^~~
<anon>:4:9: 4:12 warning: variable `DOG` should have a snake case name such as `dog`, #[warn(non_snake_case)] on by default
<anon>:4     let DOG = "Bernie";
                 ^~~
```


The resulting program will compile and run just fine, producing the output:

<lang>The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie.
```



## Run BASIC


```runbasic

dog$ = "Benjamin"
doG$ = "Smokey"
Dog$ = "Samba"
DOG$ = "Bernie"
print "The 4 dogs are "; dog$; ", "; doG$; ", "; Dog$; " and "; DOG$; "."

```



## Sather

Though by convention Sather uses all uppercase letters for class names, a variable can be
all uppercase.


```sather
class MAIN is
  main is
    dog ::= "Benjamin";
    Dog ::= "Samba";
    DOG ::= "Bernie";
    #OUT + #FMT("The three dogs are %s, %s and %s\n",
                 dog, Dog, DOG);
  end;
end;
```


Outputs:


```txt
The three dogs are Benjamin, Samba and Bernie
```



## Scala


```scala
val dog = "Benjamin"
val Dog = "Samba"
val DOG = "Bernie"
println("There are three dogs named " + dog + ", " + Dog + ", and " + DOG + ".")
```

Output:

```txt
There are three dogs named Benjamin, Samba, and Bernie.
```


## Scheme

Output may differ depending on implementation.

```scheme

## Simula

Simula identifiers are case-insensitive, and the compiler will indignantly reject a program that tries to declare multiple variables with names differing only in case. (Same with ''key words'': Case of a character in Simula ''code'' generally only matters in [http://simula67.at.ifi.uio.no/Standard-86/chap_1.htm| a simple string or a character constant].)

```simula
begin
    text dog;
    dog :- blanks( 8 );
    dog := "Benjamin";
    Dog := "Samba";
    DOG := "Bernie";
    outtext( "There is just one dog, named " );
    outtext( dog );
    outimage
end
```

```txt
There is just one dog, named Bernie
```



## Smalltalk

Smalltalk's symbols are case sensitive.


```smalltalk
|dog Dog DOG|
dog := 'Benjamin'.
Dog := 'Samba'.
DOG := 'Bernie'.
( 'The three dogs are named %1, %2 and %3' %
  { dog . Dog . DOG } ) displayNl.
```


Outputs:


```txt

## SNOBOL4


```snobol4

    dog = 'Bernie'
    OUTPUT = 'The three dogs are named ' DOG ', ' Dog ', and ' dog
END
```

```txt

## Standard ML

Standard ML is case sensitive.

```sml

  val dog = "Benjamin"
  val Dog = "Samba"
  val DOG = "Bernie"
in
  print("The three dogs are named " ^ dog ^ ", " ^ Dog ^ ", and " ^ DOG ^ ".\n")
end;
```

```txt

```



## Stata

Stata is case-sensitive.


```stata

. local DOG Bernie
. display "The three dogs are named $_dog, $_Dog, and $_DOG."
The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba, and Bernie.
```



## Swift


```swift
let dog = "Benjamin"
let Dog = "Samba"
let DOG = "Bernie"
println("The three dogs are named \(dog), \(Dog), and \(DOG).")
```



## Tcl

Tcl variable names are case sensitive:

```tcl
set dog "Benjamin"
set Dog "Samba"
set DOG "Bernie"
puts "The three dogs are named $dog, $Dog and $DOG"
```

Which prints...

```txt
The three dogs are named Benjamin, Samba and Bernie

## VBA

VBA is case sensitive case insensitive. The variable names 'dog', 'Dog' and 'DOG' can not co-exist.

```vb
Public Sub case_sensitivity()
    'VBA does not allow variables that only differ in case
    'The VBA IDE vbe will rename variable 'dog' to 'DOG'

## XLISP

XLISP is entirely case-insensitive. The user can decide whether to have the system print symbols, etc., in capitals or in lower case, by assigning to the variable <tt>*PRINT-CASE*</tt>.

```xlisp
(SETQ DOG 'BENJAMIN)
(SETQ Dog 'SAMBA)
(SETQ dog 'BERNIE)
(DISPLAY `(THERE IS JUST ONE DOG NAMED ,DOG))
```

There is, in any event, only one dog.

```txt
(THERE IS JUST ONE DOG NAMED BERNIE)
```



## XPL0

XPL0 is normally case-insensitive, so there is really just one dog named
Bernie. However, it has a command-line switch (/c) that turns case
sensitivity on. All names must start with a capital letter (or an underline, so they can't
clash with command words such as 'for'). Thus "dog" cannot be used as a
name, but Dog, DOG and DoG (and For) can. The intent of the command-line
switch (/c) is to detect inconsistent capitalizing of names such as
Ascii and ASCII or CpuReg and CPUReg.
