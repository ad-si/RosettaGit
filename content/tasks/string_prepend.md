## Task

Create a string variable equal to any text value.

Prepend the string variable with another string literal.

If your language supports any idiomatic ways to do this without referring to the variable twice in one expression, include such solutions.


To illustrate the operation, show the content of the variable.





## Ada


In Ada, a variable of type String cannot change its length. So the variable S which we will change, need to be of the type Unbounded_String. Thus the need for conversions from String literal to Unbounded_String for initialization, and from Unbounded_String to String for printing.


```Ada
with Ada.Text_IO; with Ada.Strings.Unbounded; use Ada.Strings.Unbounded;

procedure Prepend_String is
   S: Unbounded_String := To_Unbounded_String("World!");
begin
   S := "Hello " & S;-- this is the operation to prepend "Hello " to S.
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line(To_String(S));
end Prepend_String;
```

## Forth

Forth has no string prepend word, but adding it is not difficult. This demonstration starts from the low level operations that Forth gives us and quickly builds a simple set of "WORDS" (sub-routines) that let us move strings from address to address. Strings are just an address on the data stack so we can reference them as many times as we need to. Our prepend word makes use of the Return stack as a temporary storage for the address of the string we want to prepend. Standard Forth also provides a named general purpose buffer called PAD, so we make use of that too. With this PREPEND becomes part of the language.

<lang>\ the following functions are commonly native to a Forth system. Shown for completeness

: C+!     ( n addr -- ) dup c@ rot + swap c! ;             \ primitive: increment a byte at addr by n

: +PLACE  ( addr1 length addr2 -- )                        \ Append addr1 length to addr2
          2dup 2>r  count + swap move 2r> c+! ;

: PLACE   ( addr1 len addr2 -- )                           \ addr1 and length, placed at addr2 as counted string
          2dup 2>r  1+  swap  move  2r> c! ;

\ Example begins here
: PREPEND ( addr len addr2 -- addr2)
           >R                                              \ push addr2 to return stack
           PAD PLACE                                       \ place the 1st string in PAD
           R@  count PAD +PLACE                            \ append PAD with addr2 string
           PAD count R@   PLACE                            \ move the whole thing back into addr2
           R> ;                                            \ leave a copy of addr2 on the data stack

: writeln ( addr -- ) cr count type ;                      \ syntax sugar for testing
```


Test our language extensions interactively at the console

```txt
256 buffer: string1 ok
s" needs no introduction!" string1 place  ok
string1 writeln
needs no introduction! ok

s" This string "  string1 prepend writeln
This string needs no introduction! ok
```



## Fortran


### Early inability

Early Fortran had almost no ability to manipulate text except via overwriting text literals in a FORMAT statement used in a READ, that would then appear when the same FORMAT statement was used in a WRITE (!) perhaps as a heading.


### Initial difficulty

With Fortran IV came the ability to use arrays of integers and the A1 format code in READ and WRITE statements for them. With sixteen-bit integers, one might use A2 and so forth, but the numerical values of the integers would not be convenient especially if the sign bit was involved. This would be even more difficult with floating-point variables. Still, the desire for good headings and annotations and flexible layout flogged one onwards. Following the Pascal "Hello world!" example, one might proceed somewhat as follows:
```Fortran
      INTEGER*4 I,TEXT(66)
      DATA TEXT(1),TEXT(2),TEXT(3)/"Wo","rl","d!"/

      WRITE (6,1) (TEXT(I), I = 1,3)
    1 FORMAT ("Hello ",66A2)

      DO 2 I = 1,3
    2   TEXT(I + 3) = TEXT(I)
      TEXT(1) = "He"
      TEXT(2) = "ll"
      TEXT(3) = "o "

      WRITE (6,3) (TEXT(I), I = 1,6)
    3 FORMAT (66A2)
      END
```

This old-style source is acceptable to the F90 compiler as it stands. By chance, two characters per integer fits nicely but in many cases having one character per variable is easier for manipulation. So, as usual with Fortran, it's all done with arrays. The DATA statement demonstrates that a quoted string is acceptable as a value for an integer; it is just a matter of bit patterns, and this type miscegnation will work with floating-point variables also though resulting in even stranger numerical values. Looking more closely, note that an INTEGER*4 variable can hold four eight-bit characters but only two-character text literals have been specified. Unlike integer constants, which might be considered to have leading zero digits, text literals are deemed to have trailing spaces as needed: <code>"Wo"</code> is deemed to be <code>"Wo  "</code> to make up to the recipient's capacity for four characters, and when format code A2 is specified, the leftmost two characters in the variable are taken. The strange ideas of "little-endianism" have never flourished on mainframes! Thus, if the format code were to be A4, then "Wo  " would appear, not "  Wo".

The first output (to standard output: unit 6) thus prepends the text "Hello " via the workings of the nominated FORMAT statement without a further mention of variable TEXT, itself not being modified in this action. Thus, this is an example of a single-mention possibility.

Some versions of Fortran offered the ability to write to a variable such as an array rather than to a nominated output unit, via a statement like <code>WRITE (TEXT,1) (TEXT(I),I = 1,3)</code>, which array could then itself be written to the actual output via normal statements. This would involve a working variable within the routines for formatted I/O to hold the output, and thus provides one of the reasons that Fortran I/O implementations seldom enable re-entrancy - as with a WRITE statement whose output expression list includes a function evaluation, which function itself attempts to WRITE something, say to a log file, with both WRITE statements employing formatting statements. More modern compilers now require the recipient for this sort of WRITE statement to be of type CHARACTER, so the older style is blocked - and re-entrancy is still a problem.

Still another variant involved writing to unit number zero, which did not actually send anything to an output recipient. Instead, the scratchpad used by the formatted I/O system would retain whatever was produced, which could then be read back via unit number zero. Indeed, reading from unit zero would reveal whatever had been the last line of the previous I/O statement. This would be of interest if a format error had been reported on a READ during some mass data acquisition, so that the error message could show the problematic input that had been obtained rather than just complain. But this facility was not common, and did not become a part of the F90 standard. Perhaps a BACKSPACE and re-read to a text variable will work instead...

Retreating from FORMAT usage to the case of manipulating a "string" variable so as to prepend a given text to the working variable, first the existing content must be moved right to make room (again, an even number of characters is involved) which is achieved via the DO-loop, using certain constants. If on the other hand, text were to be removed from the front, then a loop would be needed to shift the surviving content leftwards. In doing this, one must pay attention to any overlaps and the direction of the loop! By chance, this exercise starts the placement after the end of the existing text but if instead the shift were to be two units, then the first-placed unit would land atop the tail end of the existing text. Thus, for rightwards shifts, one should start with the end of the surviving text and work back to its start.

Having made space, the next statements merely assign some bit patterns to elements of TEXT, and then the result is revealed, again using known constants instead of the associated variables of the more general approach. The result from the two WRITE statements is of course
```txt
Hello world!
Hello world!
```



### Character facility

With F77 came the CHARACTER type...
```Fortran
      CHARACTER*66 TEXT
      TEXT = "World!"
      TEXT = "Hello "//TEXT
      WRITE (6,*) TEXT
      END
```

This means that variable TEXT has space for 66 characters, addressed as TEXT(''first'':''last'') starting with one. There is no associated string length facility, so the first assignment places the six characters of the supplied literal, followed by spaces all the way to the end of TEXT. Alternatively, <code>TEXT(1:6) = "World!"</code> would place only six characters, leaving the rest of TEXT to hold whatever it may. This would probably be unsuitable for the next statement, which prepends "Hello " to the content of TEXT (including positions past six) and assigns the result to TEXT, overwriting its previous content - with the aid of a temporary working area. Although in principle there could be cunning schemes that update the recipient "in place" with a minimum of character copying to and fro, this doesn't happen. Only characters up to the capacity of the recipient will be transferred from the expression's result, and if the result is shorter than the capacity of the recipient, trailing spaces will be added. All of this is extra effort! And when TEXT is written out, all 66 characters will be sent forth. It is useful to have a function that locates the last non-blank character!


### Modern

With F90, and standardised in F2003, came extensions that enable a variable to be "cut-to-fit" on each usage. The first assignment would discard any storage associated with TEXT and re-assign space matching the size of the expression's result, so TEXT would have six characters. In the next statement, the expression would be evaluated and produce twelve characters (six from "Hello ", and the six of the current size of TEXT), then the current storage for text would be discarded and TEXT re-allocated to be of size twelve. At some cost in overhead. On the other hand, rather than copy the result of an expression from the scratchpad to the recipient, with re-allocation, the recipient variable could be repointed to the result area: no copying needed.

For literals, this is not a concern, as the literals are placed in buffers of the proper size by the compiler.

## Phix


```Phix
string s = "World"
s = "Hello "&s

## Prolog


In its admirable wisdom, Prolog is generally unfriendly
to state mutations and destructive assignment. However, it
is also very flexible. Using the traditional representation
of strings as lists of character codes, and the non-logical
predicate `setarg/3`, we can destructively set the head and
tail of the list to achieve a mutation of the variable holding
the string. I define an operator for the purpose:


```prolog

:- op(200, xfx, user:(=+)).

%% +Prepend =+ +Chars
%
%    Will destructively update Chars
%    So that Chars = Prepend prefixed to Chars.
%    eazar001 in ##prolog helped refine this approach.

[X|Xs] =+ Chars :-
  append(Xs, Chars, Rest),
  nb_setarg(2, Chars, Rest),
  nb_setarg(1, Chars, X).

```


Example of this abomination in action:


```prolog

?- Str = `World!`, `Hello, ` =+ Str.
Str = "Hello, World!".
```


Note: I can't imagine when I would want to do this in Prolog.
