# Take an integer n, greater than zero.
# Form the next n of its series by reversing the digits of the current n and adding the result to the current n.
# Stop when n becomes palindromic - i.e. the digits of n in reverse order == n.



The above recurrence relation when applied to most starting numbers n = 1, 2, ... terminates in a palindrome quite quickly, for example if n<sub>0</sub> = 12 we get

```txt
12
12 + 21 = 33, a palindrome!
```


And if n<sub>0</sub> = 55 we get

```txt
55
55 + 55 = 110
110 + 011 = 121, a palindrome!
```


Notice that the check for a palindrome happens ''after'' an addition.


Some starting numbers seem to go on forever; the recurrence relation for 196 has been calculated for millions of repetitions forming numbers with millions of digits, without forming a palindrome. These numbers that do not end in a palindrome are called '''Lychrel numbers'''.

For the purposes of this task a Lychrel number is any starting number that does not form a palindrome within 500 (or more) iterations.


;Seed and related Lychrel numbers:
Any integer produced in the sequence of a Lychrel number is also a Lychrel number.

In general, any sequence from one Lychrel number ''might'' converge to join the sequence from a prior Lychrel number candidate; for example the sequences for the numbers 196 and then 689 begin:

```txt
196
196 + 691 = 887
887 + 788 = 1675
1675 + 5761 = 7436
7436 + 6347 = 13783
13783 + 38731 = 52514
52514 + 41525 = 94039
...


689
689 + 986 = 1675
1675 + 5761 = 7436
...
```

So we see that the sequence starting with 689 converges to, and continues with the same numbers as that for 196. Because of this we can further split the Lychrel numbers into true '''Seed''' Lychrel number candidates, and '''Related''' numbers that produce no palindromes but have integers in their sequence seen as part of the sequence generated from a lower Lychrel number.


## Task

*  Find the number of seed Lychrel number candidates and related numbers for n in the range 1..10000 inclusive. (With that iteration limit of 500).
*  Print the number of seed Lychrels found; the actual seed Lychrels; and just the ''number'' of relateds found.
*  Print any seed Lychrel or related number that is itself a palindrome.



Show all output here.

## ALGOL 68

As suggested by the Fortran example, uses a character array to hold the large numbers for convenience.


Uses the associative array from the Associative array iteration task.

## BASIC

With minimum modifications, also:
I highly recommend to run this code in QB64. If this code is run in the other related versions, it can take about 20 minutes to run. In QB64 it only takes just seconds (11 seconds in my computer). This code has been tested to calculate up to 15000 numbers. BASIC doesn't have a way to manage such large numbers, but I implemented a way to do the sum through strings (an easy way to create a kind of array).

Almost two times slower than the Python version with LDC2, probably because of the lower efficiency of the big integers.


## Fortran

Fortran lacks built-in support for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, but fortunately, long addition is easily implemented. Digit strings are preferable anyway, as with the numbers in normal variables, there would be a lot of struggle in extracting the base ten digits - unless one was working on a base ten computer such as the IBM1620. A convenient approach is to have an array to hold the digits, with element zero having the count of digits in use. Alas, if one tries to use small digits (such as INTEGER*1) a count cannot exceed +127 and one soon finds that this problem needs longer digit strings. One could convert to using INTEGER*2, but instead the latter-day feature of defining a "type" can be employed to create a compound entity with a large integer for the count and still INTEGER*1 for the digits. An alternative for the digits would be to use a CHARACTER array, and rely on functions CHAR and ICHAR to get at the numerical values.

Arithmetic on BIGINT values is easy when only addition is needed, and there might arise special properties, for instance, imagine equivalencing the digits to a sequence of 64-bit integers and performing the addition 64-bits at a time and thus eight digits in each blow! Alas, alignment will be a problem as a digit string will not often be a multiple of eight in length and the requirement to access the digits from both ends of the string exacerbates the problem. On the other hand, one-byte integers are all very well, but the cpu will have to struggle to isolate each digit when accessing memory, as with 32-bit words or even 64-bit words. But that's a problem for the cpu. Here, the method has two parts: first is to perform the addition of all the digits in one go via a FOR ALL statement, and who knows, perhaps it will all happen in parallel. Second is a fixup pass, to spread the carries appropriately. This will involve multiple passes through the array memory so it might be better to employ a single pass with proper attention to carries: a complex loop (whose code will be in the cpu's on-chip memory) that makes lesser demands on memory transfer via one pass only. 

So the plan is to have an array STASH of BIGINT elements, and auxiliary arrays that finger elements in this stash. These arrays are needed to form the various lists of numbers of one sort or another that will be kept, and some searched. Such lists can have their elements juggled easily (being simple integers) as opposed to moving BIGINT elements about. It turns out that most numbers will be stored for one list or another, so the initial version did not escalate to a scheme for deleting numbers from the STASH so as to save storage. Later however I realised that with numbers being tested incrementally, and the ADVANCE to the next step always producing a larger number, the starting value for a march need not be stored because it will never again appear. However, sometimes the initial value ''is'' to be stored in a list (because a Long March happens to start with a palindromic number and such are to be noted, in L0P) so a fuller scheme was developed. Since usage is generally simple, there was no need for a "usecount" entry for each item when considering a "free" operation, just an AVAILS list of unused STASH entries. Not storing the start value greatly reduced the size of the PLIST (those numbers leading to a palindrome) and also removed the problem of multiple entries with equal values. The LLIST (numbers leading to a Long March) contained only 2,500 entries (500 from each of five discovered Lychrel numbers, not including their starting values) plus just four more, from numbers joining a Long March on their ''second'' step. After the second step, no value was found in either the LLIST or PLIST - the values involved soon exceeded the upper bound of 10000 for the search. And, once the values have escalated to say sixty digits (or more), a few hundred special values in a list are very unlikely to be stepped upon.

In the event, after reaching 10,000, of the 2,504 values in list LYCHREL known to lead to a long march, just a further nine were less than 20,000, the twenty-first was 109,989 and the twenty-ninth was 1,067,869. Of those 652 known to lead to a palindrome, 213 were less than 10,000 (and so will never be referred to again) and entry 385 was 19,888. Extending the inspection to 20,000 extended 652 to 3,940 such that entry 428 was 20,091. There were now 42 Lychrel potentials with 21,070 waypoints stored but only 15 were less than 20,000. These lists could be purged of their no-longer needed early entries, say after every thousand inspections, but the LYCHREL list's growth is the problem. Its numerous very large numbers (now up to 224 digits) are very unlikely to be stepped upon, but even so, the joiners of a Long March increased from 244 to 662. Whereas in the first ten thousand, all such latecomers to a Long March were discovered by their second step, 10,653 is found on its ''fourth'' step to be 903,408, and 14,995 attained 182,353,171 on step eight. Thus, trimming the not-so-many early values won't reduce the storage demand by much, and of the more numerous larger values, one might, just might, be stepped upon again thus declaring a sequence's start to be not a "seed" value...

The service routines are not presented with an index to the STASH, but an actual BIGINT as the parameter, thereby enabling dereferencing. That is, for access via the STASH, a number's digit is accessed with two indices: STASH(i).DIGIT(j) but if a BIGINT is passed as a parameter, its digits may be accessed via one dimension only, often a significant saving. Though not if parameters are passed via copy-in, copy-out! Some languages, such as Pascal have a "with" statement, which achieves dereferencing somewhat as follows: <code>With Stash[i] do ... Digit[j] ...;</code> so that within its scope, all mentions of Digit are implicitly Stash[i].Digit and who knows, the compiler might produce good code as well.

Early trial runs showed that a list may have thousands of numbers, and many linear searches of so many can be expected to be slow - indeed, a pause in the production of results was apparent. So, a binary search. But this requires a sorted list. The Combsort works well, but greatly slowed execution because the complete sorting of a list takes time when it is done often. Fortunately, most additions to the lists are in increasing numerical order, so Insertionsort proved far better - though in the event the speed was about the same as for a linear search with no sorting. Ah well. Otherwise, one would be stuck with having a sorted area and an overflow area (unsorted) for a compound search, with a full sort whenever the overflow area becomes big enough. Or, escalating to a hash-based scheme. Even so, this encouraged a second try at speeding the calculation. The numbers of a march all being increasing means that an ordered collection of values is to hand and so, lists of such numbers can be kept in sorted order without having to be resorted. In the event, typically just a few (often just one) value is being added, or occasionally, the five hundred values of a long march. So, for the few, add them one at a time by using a variant of the Insertionsort, where the location for insertion is determined by a binary search thus greatly reducing the number of calls to ORDER. Further, the shifting of entries to make room can be done in one array-assignment statement, rather than stepwise. For the many, a merge process is the obvious scheme. With these improvements, the results appeared without delay, as fast as the screen could scroll.

But at the cost of added effort in programming. As distinct from languages already offering associative arrays, lists and their manipulation as built-in facilities.

The growth of the numbers was impressive, so a simple investigation: what of the growth per step for 196? The digit strings lengthened in a linear-looking way, so, what of a plot of step as x, vs Log10(n) as y? The result for 500 numbers went from step 0 and Log10(196) = 2·292256 to step 499 and 215·266386 and the linear correlation coefficient came out as 1·000 with y = 0·43328*x + 2·1616, which is to say that each advance increased the number by a factor of about 2·7. However, the plot (which alas, can't be posted here) does ''not'' show a random scatter about the straight line, it instead shows the points wobbling above and below the fitted line. A plot of the residuals shows the deviations coming in waves, but also cannot be posted here...

C   Entries in LIST are such that STASH(LIST(~)) is ordered. Because I arrange this.
C   Entries MARCH are also in increasing order as they are successive values from ADVANCE.
C   Accordingly, if only a few entries are to be added, a binary search can be used to find the
C location for insertion, and then existing entries can be shifted up to make room for the new entry.
C This is the basic task of Insertionsort, however, this shift can be conducted without invoking ORDER
C to determine its bounds, as is done by Insertionsort, and ORDER takes a lot of time to decide.
C In other words, the binary search makes only a few calls to ORDER and then the moves follow, in one go,
C whereas the Insertionsort makes as many calls to ORDER as it makes moves, and does so stepwise.
C   When many entries are to be added, they could be appended to LIST and then COMBSORT invoked.
C This is infrequent as few numbers evoke a lengthy march, so that method is adequate.
C But since both lists are in order, a merge of the two lists would be more stylish, if encoded clunkily.
C   It turns out that the incoming set may finger a value that is already in LIST,
c so equal values may appear. With the binary search method, such incomers can simply be skipped,
c but with the merge it is a bit more messy. In the event, the new value is discarded and the
c old one retained.
C   For instance, 5 -> 10 -> 11 so fingers for 5 and 10 are added to PLIST.
C Later on, 10 -> 11 and a finger for 10 is to be added to PLIST, because the starting value is not checked.
C However, a later version refrains from adding the (unchecked) starting value, and then, no worries.

Output: edited to put twenty numbers per line and omit the (1:''n'') of the output from BIGWRITE...
Of the starters that joined a long march, six did so with their starting value (not tested for, just as the starting value is not tested to see if it is already a palindrome): they were 887, 1675, 1857, 7436, 9438, and 9988. Different long marches are involved: 887, 1675 and 7436 belong to 196 whereas 1857 and 9438 belong to 879, and 9438 belongs to 1997.

## J


Reverse digits:


```J
revdig=:('x',~|.)&.":"0
```


Note that we need extended precision numbers because 500 iterations gets us into very large numbers even when we start small. For example, starting from 12:


```J
   (+revdig)^:500(12)
989330226271793404132120335101444022368928728236373385750622261099268167362912850818170039990942038798808908830140199820181718948328173760873880172226156484473632718819962221534191534021132404387162721132989
```


Test whether a number is a lychrel (true or related) number within that 500 iteration limit:


```J
lychrel500=: (~: revdig)@((+^:~: revdig)^:500)@(+revdig)"0
```


Number of these lychrel numbers not exceeding 10000 (we start from 0 here, because that's natural for J's primitives, so we need 10001 integers if we are to reach 10000):


```J
   #L=:I.lychrel500 i.10001
249
```


(What are they? Note that this isn't a task requirement - just curiosity.)


```J

   S=:(+revdig)^:(i.501)"0 L
```


And, let's take a peek at some of the numbers in these sequences (the first 10 values in each lychrel sequence, starting from the first lychrel candidate seeds):


```J
   10 10 {.S
196  887 1675  7436 13783  52514  94039  187088  1067869 10755470
295  887 1675  7436 13783  52514  94039  187088  1067869 10755470
394  887 1675  7436 13783  52514  94039  187088  1067869 10755470
493  887 1675  7436 13783  52514  94039  187088  1067869 10755470
592  887 1675  7436 13783  52514  94039  187088  1067869 10755470
689 1675 7436 13783 52514  94039 187088 1067869 10755470 18211171
691  887 1675  7436 13783  52514  94039  187088  1067869 10755470
788 1675 7436 13783 52514  94039 187088 1067869 10755470 18211171
790  887 1675  7436 13783  52514  94039  187088  1067869 10755470
879 1857 9438 17787 96558 182127 903408 1707717  8884788 17759676
```


So most of these are related... which ones are not? (An integer is owned if it is in the sequence for this lychrel candidate or for any previous candidates. A lychrel candidate is a true lychrel number if none of its sequence is owned by any previous candidate.)


```J
   owned=: <@~.@,\S
   #T=: (-. (<"1 S) +./@e.&> a:,}:owned)#L
5
   T
196 879 1997 7059 9999
```


And, with that, we can find the count of "just related" lychrel numbers:


```J
   L -&# T
244
```


And, finally, which of the (true or related) lychrel numbers were themselves palindromes?


```J
   (#~(=revdig))L
4994 8778 9999
```


To reiterate, here's the collected definitions with the task required results (everything above this point was basically just documentation - J tends to need that kind of documentation, because of the nature of the language):


```J
   revdig=:('x',~|.)&.":"0
   lychrel500=: (~: revdig)@((+^:~: revdig)^:500)@(+revdig)"0
   L=:I.lychrel500 i.10001
   S=:(+revdig)^:(i.501)"0 L
   owned=: <@~.@,\S
   #T=: (-. (<"1 S) +./@e.&> a:,}:owned)#L
5
   T
196 879 1997 7059 9999
   L -&# T
244
   (#~(=revdig))L
4994 8778 9999
```


T is the "seed" or "true" lychrel numbers, and #T is how many of them we found. L is all of the candidates (both seeds and relateds), so the difference in the lengths of L and T is the number of related.

## Mathematica

A few convenient functions:

```Mathematica
palindromeQ[n_Integer] := 
 Block[{digits = IntegerDigits[n]}, digits == Reverse@digits]

nextNumber[n_Integer] := n + FromDigits[Reverse@IntegerDigits@n]

lychrelQ[n_Integer] := ! 
  palindromeQ@
   Catch[Nest[If[palindromeQ[#], Throw[#], nextNumber[#]] &, 
     nextNumber[n], 500]]
```


A list of all integers less 10,000 that do not evolve to a palindrome in 500 iterations

```Mathematica
candidates = Cases[Range[10000], _?(lychrelQ@# &)];
```

The Lychrel seeds can be obtained from the list of candidates as follows:

```Mathematica
seeds = {};
NestWhile[(seeds = {seeds, First@#}; 
   test = NestList[nextNumber, First@#, 10]; 
   DeleteCases[
    Rest[#], _?(IntersectingQ[test, 
        NestList[nextNumber, #, 10]] &)]) &, candidates, 
 Length@# > 0 &]; seeds = Flatten@seeds
```

```txt

{196,879,1997,7059,9999}
```

Note, here only 10 iterations were done for comparison. While reducing the number of
iterations is clearly effective for intergers less than 10,000 this may not be sufficient
for all integers.

The number of related Lychrel numbers is:

```Mathematica
Length@candidates - Length@seeds
```

```txt
244

```

The Lycrel numbers that are also palindromes are:

```Mathematica
Cases[candidates, _?(palindromeQ@# &)]
```

```txt
{4994,8778,9999}

```


=={{Header|Pascal}}==
I use an array of byte.The trick is to add first, so i don't need to create a reversed number and only have to sum up one half and than correct the carry, which is most time consuming.
I don't limit the cycles but the digits, which makes string comparisons much easier.
A pre-check, when 10 digits are reached speed things up.But i have to take into account, that many numbers, reaching 10 digits, are not lychrel.
Using a simple array instead of Stringlist for related lychrels saves enourmous amount of memory ( 2Gb -> 100Mb //maxnum= 100 Mio )
The main intention was to get below 1min for 100e6 ;-)

If we test the numbers in ascending order, many of them would have been encountered when checking smaller numbers (i.e. 10 is seen when testing 5), caching them causes a large performance boost, more so with larger ranges.

```python

    if n in cache: return cache[n]

    for i in range(1000):
        n += r
        r = rev(n)
        if n == r:
            res = (False, 0)
            break
        if n in cache:

## Tcl


As we collect Lychrel numbers, we can save some time by storing all the members of their orbits in a hash table so that related numbers can be quickly identified.  This is what the <tt>$visited</tt> variable is for:  using the keys of a dictionary (or on earlier Tcl versions, an array) for a hash table is a common trick in Tcl.  Native bignums mean we don't have to worry about overflow


```Tcl
proc pal? {n} {
    expr {$n eq [string reverse $n]}
}

proc step {n} {
    set n_ [string reverse $n]
    set n_ [string trimleft $n_ 0]
    expr {$n + $n_}
}

proc lychrels {{max 10000} {iters 500}} {

    set lychrels {}     ;# true Lychrels
    set visited {}      ;# visited numbers for Related test
    set nRelated 0      ;# count of related numbers seen
    set pals {}         ;# palindromic Lychrels and related

    puts "Searching for Lychrel numbers in \[1,$max\]"
    puts "With a maximum of $iters iterations"

    for {set i 1} {$i <= $max} {incr i} {
        set n $i        ;# seed the sequence
        set seq {}      ;# but don't check the seed, nor remember it for the Related test
        for {set j 0} {$j < $iters} {incr j} {

## zkl

Uses the GNU GMP big int library.

The Lychrel number chain is stored as a long string with '\0' separating each number, which we can then search to find relateds.

```zkl
var BN=Import("zklBigNum");

   // 192-->"887\01675\07436\013783\0..." ~60k bytes
fcn lychrel(n,returnListof=False){ n=BN(n); //-->Bool|Data(==StringBuf)
   sink:=(if(returnListof) Data(0,String) else Void);
   nls:=(500).pump(sink,'wrap(){
      ns:=n.add(BN(n.toString().reverse())).toString();
      if(ns==ns.reverse()) return(Void.Stop,False);  // not a Lychrel number
      ns
   });
   if(nls) if(returnListof) return(sink.mode(Int).howza(2)) else return(True);
   False;
}
fcn isPalindrome(n){ n==n.toString().reverse().toInt() }
fcn findSeeds(lychrels){
   seeds:=List(lychrels[0]);
   foreach n,lnns in ([1..].zip(lychrels[1,*])){ ln,seq:=lnns;
      foreach _,s2 in (seeds){
	 foreach s3 in (seq){
	    if(Void!=(z:=s2.findString(s3)) and 0==s2[z-1]) break(2);
	 }
      }
      fallthrough{ seeds.append(lnns) }
   }
   seeds.apply("get",0)
}
```


```zkl
lychrels:=[1..0d10_000].filter(lychrel).apply(fcn(n){ T(n,lychrel(n,True)) });
println("[1..10,000] contains ",lychrels.len()," Lychrel numbers.");

lychrels.pump(List,fcn([(n,_)]){ isPalindrome(n) and n or Void.Skip })
   .println("<-- Palindromic Lychrel numbers");

(n:=findSeeds(lychrels))
.println("<-- Lychrel seeds (%d) ==> %d related"
.fmt(n.len(),lychrels.len() - n.len()));
```
