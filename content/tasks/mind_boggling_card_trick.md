Matt Parker of the "Stand Up Maths channel" has a   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNpGxZ_1KXU <u>YouTube video</u>]   of a card trick that creates a semblance of order from chaos.

The task is to simulate the trick in a way that mimics the steps shown in the video.

; 1. Cards.
# Create a common deck of cards of 52 cards    (which are half red, half black).
# Give the pack a good shuffle.
; 2. Deal from the shuffled deck, you'll be creating three piles.
#   Assemble the cards face down.
##   Turn up the   ''top card''   and hold it in your hand. 
###    if the card is         black,        then add the   ''next''   card (unseen) to the       "black"      pile. 
###    If the card is     red,    then add the   ''next''   card (unseen) to the   "red"  pile.
##   Add the   ''top card''   that you're holding to the '''discard''' pile.   (You might optionally show these discarded cards to get an idea of the randomness).
# Repeat the above for the rest of the shuffled deck.
; 3. Choose a random number   (call it '''X''')   that will be used to swap cards from the "red" and "black" piles.
# Randomly choose   '''X'''   cards from the   "red"  pile (unseen), let's call this the   "red"  bunch. 
# Randomly choose   '''X'''   cards from the       "black"      pile (unseen), let's call this the      "black"       bunch.
# Put the     "red"    bunch into the         "black"      pile.
# Put the        "black"        bunch into the      "red"  pile.
# (The above two steps complete the swap of   '''X'''   cards of the "red" and "black" piles. 
 (Without knowing what those cards are --- they could be red or black, nobody knows).
; 4. Order from randomness?
# Verify (or not) the mathematician's assertion that: 
     <big> '''The number of black cards in the "black" pile equals the number of red cards in the "red" pile.''' </big>


(Optionally, run this simulation a number of times, gathering more evidence of the truthfulness of the assertion.)

First sample run:

```txt

After dealing the cards the state of the stacks is:
  Red    : 15 cards -> [B R R R R B R B R B B R B B B]
  Black  : 11 cards -> [R B R B B R R B B B B]
  Discard: 26 cards -> [R R R R B B B B B B B R R R B B B R R R R R R B R R]

8 card(s) are to be swapped.

The respective zero-based indices of the cards(s) to be swapped are:
  Red    : [10  2 11 14 12  3  9  5]
  Black  : [ 7 10  3  0  5  8  6  1]

After swapping, the state of the red and black stacks is:
  Red    : [B R B B R B R B R R B B R B R]
  Black  : [B B R R B B B B R B R]

The number of red cards in the red stack     = 7
The number of black cards in the black stack = 7
So the asssertion is correct!

```


Second sample run:

```txt

After dealing the cards the state of the stacks is:
  Red    : 12 cards -> [B B R B R R R B B B R B]
  Black  : 14 cards -> [B R R R B R R B B R R B R R]
  Discard: 26 cards -> [R R B B B R R B B B R R R B B B R B B B R B R R R B]

2 card(s) are to be swapped.

The respective zero-based indices of the cards(s) to be swapped are:
  Red    : [ 1  6]
  Black  : [11 12]

After swapping, the state of the red and black stacks is:
  Red    : [B B R B R R R B B B R B]
  Black  : [B R R R B R R B B R R B R R]

The number of red cards in the red stack     = 5
The number of black cards in the black stack = 5
So the asssertion is correct!

## J

The trick verb returns 0 if the magician's proposition fails, otherwise 1.

```J

  NB. A failed assertion looks like this
   assert 0
|assertion failure: assert
|       assert 0

```
   
We find that in three runs the trick works.

```J

```


First sample run:

```txt

After dealing the cards the state of the stacks is:
  Red    : 10 cards -> [R, R, B, R, R, B, B, R, R, R]
  Black  : 16 cards -> [B, B, R, R, R, R, B, R, R, B, R, B, B, R, R, B]
  Discard: 26 cards -> [R, B, B, B, R, R, B, B, B, R, B, B, B, B, R, B, R, B, R, R, R, R, B, B, B, B]

7 card(s) are to be swapped

The respective zero-based indices of the cards(s) to be swapped are:
  Red    : [3, 5, 6, 1, 4, 9, 7]
  Black  : [2, 0, 3, 15, 14, 12, 7]

After swapping, the state of the red and black stacks is:
  Red    : [R, B, B, R, R, B, R, R, R, B]
  Black  : [B, B, R, B, R, R, B, R, R, B, R, B, R, R, R, R]

The number of red cards in the red stack     = 6
The number of black cards in the black stack = 6
So the asssertion is correct!

```


Second sample run:

```txt

After dealing the cards the state of the stacks is:
  Red    : 11 cards -> [B, R, R, B, R, B, R, B, B, B, R]
  Black  : 15 cards -> [B, R, R, R, B, R, R, R, B, R, R, R, B, R, B]
  Discard: 26 cards -> [B, R, R, B, B, R, R, B, B, R, R, B, B, B, B, R, R, B, B, B, R, R, B, B, B, R]

3 card(s) are to be swapped

The respective zero-based indices of the cards(s) to be swapped are:
  Red    : [4, 2, 3]
  Black  : [0, 14, 2]

After swapping, the state of the red and black stacks is:
  Red    : [B, R, B, R, B, B, R, B, B, B, R]
  Black  : [R, R, B, R, B, R, R, R, B, R, R, R, B, R, R]

The number of red cards in the red stack     = 4
The number of black cards in the black stack = 4
So the asssertion is correct!

## Python

The code is layed out to follow the task decription, leading to some deviations from the PEP8 ''guidelines''

```python
import random

## 1. Cards
n = 52
Black, Red = 'Black', 'Red'
blacks = [Black] * (n // 2) 
reds = [Red] * (n // 2)
pack = blacks + reds
# Give the pack a good shuffle.
random.shuffle(pack)

## 2. Deal from the randomised pack into three stacks
black_stack, red_stack, discard = [], [], []
while pack:
    top = pack.pop()
    if top == Black:
        black_stack.append(pack.pop())
    else:
        red_stack.append(pack.pop())
    discard.append(top)
print('(Discards:', ' '.join(d[0] for d in discard), ')\n')

## 3. Swap the same, random, number of cards between the two stacks.
# We can't swap more than the number of cards in a stack.
max_swaps = min(len(black_stack), len(red_stack))
# Randomly choose the number of cards to swap.
swap_count = random.randint(0, max_swaps)
print('Swapping', swap_count)
# Randomly choose that number of cards out of each stack to swap.
def random_partition(stack, count):
    "Partition the stack into 'count' randomly selected members and the rest"
    sample = random.sample(stack, count)
    rest = stack[::]
    for card in sample:
        rest.remove(card)
    return rest, sample

black_stack, black_swap = random_partition(black_stack, swap_count)
red_stack, red_swap = random_partition(red_stack, swap_count)

# Perform the swap.
black_stack += red_swap
red_stack += black_swap

## 4. Order from randomness?
if black_stack.count(Black) == red_stack.count(Red):
    print('Yeha! The mathematicians assertion is correct.')
else:
    print('Whoops - The mathematicians (or my card manipulations) are flakey')
```

After the deal the state of the piles is:

 Red pile: R B B B B B R B R R R B R B B 
 Discard pile: R R R R B R R R B R R B R B R R B R B R B B B R B B 
 
10 cards are being swapped.

After the swap the state of the piles is: 
 Black pile: R B B B B R R R R B R 
 Red pile: B B R B B B R B B B B R B R R 
 
There are 5 black cards in the black pile.
There are 5 red cards in the red pile.
The assertion is true!

## REXX

Programming notes:   This REXX version uses a neat trick that the '''Python''' entry uses:   instead of using a deck of

cards,   it just uses a "deck" of numbers that correspond to the order of playing cards that came out of a new box of 

cards.   Odd numbers represent red cards, even numbers represent black cards.

This could've been possibly simplified by using negative and positive numbers,   ''or''   more accurately,   the suits and 

a pip, but it would've taken more program logic to determine the color of the suits in a very succinct and efficient way.

Also, code was added to perform any number of trials.   Code was also added to allow repeatability by specifying a 

''seed''   value for the   '''random'''   BIF. 

A new deck of cards is always created     ''as if the playing cards were manufactured and put into a box'',     that is,

13 spades (<big>♠</big>) in a row   (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K),     13 
hearts (<big>♥</big>),     13 clubs (<big>♣</big>),     and 13 diamonds (<big>♦</big>).

(Various card playing manufacturers would arrange a new playing deck differently, but that isn't a concern.)

The number of cards in the deck and also the number of shuffles can be specified.   One shuffle swaps two random

cards, two shuffles swaps four random cards ···

Extra coding was added to keep ''singularities''   (opposite of a plural)   to keep the English gooder (''sic''),   as well as 

adding commas to larger numbers.
