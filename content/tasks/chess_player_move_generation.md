{{draft task|Move generation}} This is a sub-task of the Chess player task.

Using suitable data structures, generate a list of valid moves given a chess game position and the side-to-move. You can create a basic (and incomplete) solution or create an advanced solution which covers all possible moves and depends on tracking more of the game state.

Basic implementation:
#Moves based on piece type
#Promotion to queen
#Allow resignation 
More advanced/full implementation:
#Castling (not through check) 
#En-passant capture
#All promotions
#Move legality for moving in/out of check 
#Draw by repetition and 50-move rule

Describe how complete your solution is, and try to create a self-contained component which could be used by a complete chess program.
