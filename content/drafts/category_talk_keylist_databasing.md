So this is a language? If so it needs a {{tmpl|language}} template at the start and it needs to be on the [[:Category:KeyList Databasing]] page. You may want to consider trimming down what you show here. Short examples and explanatory text are fine on the language pages, but I think it might be best to demonstrate this in tasks (plus I almost got knocked out of my chair when I opened this page and got hit with a [[wiktionary:wall of text|wall of text]]). Code samples should be enclosed in lang tags with an argument for the language they show (for this one I would go with <nowiki>
```keylist
code code code>
```
</nowiki
). See [[Rosetta Code:Add a Language]] for other instructions for adding a language. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:37, 26 July 2011 (UTC)

Yeah, the language, (if you read this closely) only runs on BrailleNotes. I might need some help getting this to a category and managing the templates. [[User:Star651|Star651]] 21:19, 26 July 2011 (UTC)
:Give it a shot on your own. I'll check back and fix anything that goes wrong (I promise I won't get mad). Check that help page and the page for the language template for tips and tricks. Also check other language category pages to see how they work. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 22:38, 26 July 2011 (UTC)

Okay, this is me, re-doing the page, without reading tips. Added templates, lang tags (which look like HTML, MediaWiki must be a ripoff lol), but look at it now. Is anything better? [[User:Star651|Star651]] 20:46, 27 July 2011 (UTC)
:Looks good. The lang tags are actually an extension we use here. They're made to look like HTML just because lots of people understand it and it's pretty simple syntax. There's still a lot of information on the page that's really just demonstration, but it's formatted correctly and the page is set up correctly. Good job! --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 20:55, 27 July 2011 (UTC)
