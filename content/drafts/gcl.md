{{implementation|Common Lisp}}
[http://www.gnu.org/software/gcl/ GCL] is Gnu Common Lisp.

GCL is a Common Lisp currently compliant with the CLtL1 standard. Lisp compilation produces native code through the intermediary of the system's C compiler, from which GCL derives efficient performance and facile portability. Currently uses TCL/Tk as GUI.
