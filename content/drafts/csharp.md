C# is an object-oriented programming language
developed by Microsoft as part of their .NET initiative,
and later approved as a standard by ECMA and ISO.

C# has a procedural, object-oriented syntax based on C++
that includes aspects of several other programming languages
(most notably Delphi and Java)
with a particular emphasis on simplification
(fewer symbolic requirements than C++,
fewer declarative requirements than Java).
