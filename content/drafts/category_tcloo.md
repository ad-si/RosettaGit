{{library}}
TclOO is a library for [[Tcl]] 8.5, which provides access to the same object-oriented programming facilities as are built directly into Tcl 8.6. For backward compatibility, Tcl 8.6 also provides this package; this means that user code that needs an object system can just do:

```tcl
package require TclOO
```

See the [http://wiki.tcl.tk/TclOO TclOO page] on the Tcler's Wiki for more information.
