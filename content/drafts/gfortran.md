'''gfortran''' is the name of the GNU Fortran compiler, which is part of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]]. gfortran has replaced the g77 compiler, which stopped development before GCC version 4.0. It includes support for the [[wp:Fortran#Fortran_95|Fortran 95]] language and is compatible with most language extensions supported by g77, allowing it to serve as a drop-in replacement in many cases. Parts of [[wp:Fortran#Fortran 2003|Fortran 2003]] and [[wp:Fortran#Fortran 2008|Fortran 2008]] have also been implemented.
