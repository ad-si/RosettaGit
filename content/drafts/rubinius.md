Rubinius is a Ruby interpreter that translates Ruby to LLVM bytecode, and then to native machine code. Rubinius also implements most of the core library in Ruby. It also has its [http://rubini.us/doc/en/systems/concurrency/ 'actor' library].

Rubinius 1.2.x only implements Ruby 1.8.7, it cannot run Ruby 1.9 code.
