== J ==

Unlike the concise solution to [[Talk:Zig Zag#epilogue|ZigZag]], this [[Spiral#J|J function]] works entirely on a list, until the very end, when it reshapes the 1D list into the 2D array.

So if <tt>SPIRAL</tt>:

    SPIRAL=:spiral 5

is our spiral array, then <tt>,SPIRAL</tt> is the rows catenated together:

    ,SPIRAL
 0 1 2 3 4 15 16 17 18 5 14 23 24 19 6 13 22 21 20 7 12 11 10 9 8


###  insight no. 1 


Nothing about this list pops out at me, but if you read the [http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/play132.htm original article], you'll see a smart J guy (Joey Tuttle) noticed that this list looks like the ''grade'' of another list.


###  aside:  grading 


As I said in my [[Talk:Zig Zag#reading the J examples|earlier exposition]], a grade represents the ''permutation vector'' required to sort the list.

Let's say in some non-J language, you had a list of chars:

   ['E','C','D','F','A','B' ]

Well, if you take that list, and make it a 2D array where the chars are the first column, and the index is the second column:

   [ ['E',0],
     ['C',1],
     ['D',2],
     ['F',3],
     ['A',4],
     ['B',5] ]

And then sort that 2D array (either by the first column, or by both, which is equivalent), you'd get this:

  [ ['A',4],
    ['B',5],
    ['C',1],
    ['D',2],
    ['E',0],
    ['F',3] ]

Pulling out the second column from the matrix (the integers), you'd get this:

   [4,5,1,2,0,3]

Which is the grade.  

Well, in J, you don't use sort to get the grade, you use grade to get the sort.  For example, get the grade:

    /:'ECDFAB'
 4 5 1 2 0 3

then use that grade to index into the array:

    4 5 1 2 0 3 { 'ECDFAB'
 ABCDEF

(in J indexing is a function, not part of the syntax.  So, for example, <tt>x[4]</tt> in C becomes <tt>4{x</tt> in J).


###  chasing Joey 


Ok, back to the spiral.  When we left off, Joey had begun to suspect that <tt>,SPIRAL</tt> was actually a permutation vector.  That is, that <tt>,SPIRAL</tt> was the result of grading some other list. More formally, he suspected:

   (,SPIRAL) = (/: something_else)

But how to find <tt>something_else</tt>?  Well, it may not be obvious, but <tt>/:</tt> is self-inverse.  That is, if you apply it twice, it "undoes" itself. 
     /: 4 5 1 2 0 3
 4 2 3 5 0 1
    
    /: /: 4 5 1 2 0 3
 4 5 1 2 0 3
    
    4 5 1 2 0 3 = (/: /: 4 5 1 2 0 3)
 1 1 1 1 1 1
So, since we know 
    something_else = (/: /: something_else)
and  
    (,SPIRAL) = (/: something_else)
then, by substitution, we know 
    something_else = (/: , SPIRAL)
If you're still iffy on function inverse, don't worry, we'll return to it later, and find out a more formal way to ask J to invert a function for us.

In any case, let's see what Joey saw:
    /: , SPIRAL
 0 1 2 3 4 9 14 19 24 23 22 21 20 15 10 5 6 7 8 13 18 17 16 11 12


###  insight no. 2 


I don't see obvious patterns when I look at the result of <tt>/: , SPIRAL</tt> above.  But then, I'm not as smart as Joey.  When he looked at it, he had a second insight:  this array looks like a ''running-sum''.

Here's what I mean by running-sum:

    +/\ 1 2 3 4     NB. running sum
 1 3 6 10
   
    (1),(1+2),(1+2+3),(1+2+3+4)
 1 3 6 10

Formally, Joey suspected:
  (/: , SPIRAL) = (+/\ another_thing)
But obviously <tt>+/\</tt> is not self-inverse.  So how can we discover <tt>another_thing</tt>?  

<b>''We ask J to do it for us''</b>.


###  aside: calculus of functions 


J provides for a calculus of functions.  What is a "calculus of functions"?  Well, just like functions act on data to produce data, we can have meta-functions that operate on functions to produce functions.

Think back to math notation <small><sup>[[#notes|1]]</sup></small>:

   log <b>x</b>   # (1) log of x
   log <b>x</b><sup>2</sup>  # (2) log of x * x
   log<sup>2</sup> <b>x</b>  # (3) log of log of x

Read the (3) again.  How is it different from (2)?  In (2), <tt><b>x</b></tt> has been manipulated, but in (3) ''<tt>log</tt>'' has been manipulated!

That is, in (2), there are two instances of <tt><b>x</b></tt> (in <tt><b>x</b>*<b>x</b></tt>), but in (3) there are two instances of <tt>log</tt> (in <tt>log(log(<b>x</b>))</tt>).

Analogously in J:
   log =: 10&^.  NB.  "^." is the log function in J
   x   =: 100
   log x         NB. (1) log of x
 2
   log x^2       NB. (2) log of x*x
 4
   log^:2 x      NB. (3) log of log of x
 0.30103
Now let's take this one step further.  You'll remember the notation 
   <b>x</b><sup>-1</sup>  # (4)
meant <tt>1/x</tt>, that is, the inverse of the number <tt>x</tt>.  But what did 
   log<sup>-1</sup> # (5)
mean?  By analogy to (4), (5) meant ''the inverse of the log function''.

Analogously in J:

    x^_1                   NB.  (4)
 0.01
    log x   
 2
    log_inverse =: log^:_1 NB.  (5)
 
    log_inverse log x  
 100

Neat, huh?  

=== caught him! ===

So what does all this have to do with our hero, Joey?  Well, if you remember, he had the insight that <tt>(/: , SPIRAL) =(+/\ another_thing)</tt>.  But he was stumped: <tt>+/\</tt> is not self-inverse, so how could he recover <tt>another_thing</tt>?

Well, now we know how he proceeded:  <tt>+/\^:_1</tt>.  Let's follow him:

    +/\^:_1 /: ,SPIRAL
 0 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 5 _1 _1 _1 _1 _5 _5 _5 1 1 1 5 5 _1 _1 _5 1

<b>Eureka</b>!  This list clearly shows a pattern.  We can simply replicate the pattern, then undo (invert) the operations that generated it from <tt>SPIRAL</tt>, and we'll have our <tt>SPIRAL</tt> back.  


###  home again 


Put another way: if we can generate these ones-and-fives, we can generate <tt>SPIRAL</tt>.  How?  Well, since we generated the ones-and-fives from <tt>SPIRAL</tt> using:

    ones_and_fives =. +/\^:_1 /: , SPIRAL

Then we need to do the opposite of that to recover <tt>SPIRAL</tt>.  To break this procedure down, we have:
  
    func3 =. +/\^:_1
    func2 =. /:
    func1 =. ,
 
    ones_and_fives =. func3 func2 func1 SPIRAL

Obviously if you're doing the "opposite" of something you proceed LIFO.  That is, given <tt><b>y</b> = func3(func2(func1(<b>x</b>)))</tt>, then <tt><b>x</b> =  func1<sup>-1</sup>(func2<sup>-1</sup>func3<sup>-1</sup>(<b>y</b>)))</tt> <sup><small>[[#notes|2]]</small></sup>.

That is:

    SPIRAL =. func1^:_1 func2^:_1 func3^:_1 ones_and_fives

and we know:

# The inverse of an inverse is the thing itself, so <tt>func3^:_1</tt> is merely <tt>+/\</tt>.  
#  The function <tt>/:</tt> is self-inverse, so <tt>func2^:_1</tt> is merely <tt>/:</tt> (though <tt>/:^:_1</tt> would work as well).  
# The function <tt>,</tt> (''ravel'') is not invertible: it loses information (it is possible that <tt>(,x)=(,y)</tt> is true but <tt>x=y</tt> is not). But that's ok, we have the information that it lost: it's the original shape of <tt>SPIRAL</tt>, which is the input to our function!  So we can undo the ravel.


###  conclusion 


Putting that all together, we conclude:

    SPIRAL =. (input) reshape /: +/\ ones_and_fives 

In English:

:''Joey discovered a very simple pattern underlying the spiral arrays.  The spiral itself is merely the grade of the running-sum of this pattern, reshaped into a matrix.''

Generating the underlying pattern (<tt>ones_and_fives</tt>) is left as an exercise for the reader.  But, if you get stuck, it's spelled out in [http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/play132.htm the original article].


###  notes 

# For simplicity, here <tt>log</tt> means log-base-10, or <tt>log<sub>10</sub></tt>.
# In fact, LIFO of inverses is exactly how J inverts  composite functions.

: Yet another J solution that looks both interesting and impenetrable to me. at least for [[Zig Zag]] a Haskel person had reimplemented the J solution and left me the clue that it involved a sort :-) 
:--[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 16:56, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
::This one includes a sort, too :)  That's one of the neatest parts!  Alright, let me write out the algo real quick (I'll gloss over details and may fib a bit, to get the idea across quickly).


== Python array initialisation edit problem ==
Hi Spoon, your edit to Spiral of substituting <python>array = [[None]*n]*n</python> for <python>array = [[None]*n for j in range(n)]</python> [[http://www.rosettacode.org/w/index.php?title=Spiral&curid=2967&diff=16906&oldid=16746 here]] doesn't work because of: 

```python
>>>
 n=2
>>> a = [[None]*n]*n
>>> a
[[None, None], [None, None]]
>>> a[0][0] = 1
>>> a
[[1, None], [1, None]]
>>>
```

You are referencing the inner list multiple times instead of creating new copies. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] 06:17, 14 August 2008 (UTC)

== Spiral Matrix implementation in VBA ==

hii
i came across this page during a search for a mechanism to implement the spiral matrix in VBA bt unfortunately it was not listed here. But afrterwards by translating the java code i manage to obtain the result. I beleive a lot f peopla have manage to do this but didnt come across anyone who has shared it
so here it goes....

:Howdy, and welcome to RC (if appropriate). Might I suggest creating an account?
:Having said that, code submissions really should go on [[Spiral matrix|the task's page]], and not its talk page. I've moved it for you: [[Spiral matrix#VBA]]. I made some changes so that it is more generalized; your use of <code>Init</code> (which I assume sets up certain starting conditions) doesn't help anyone without access to your code.
:(As a minor aside, I have to wonder at your use of cells way down in the 400+ range. For something like this, I'd think that just starting at A1 would be acceptable.)
