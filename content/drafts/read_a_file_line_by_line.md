## AWK

Reading files line-by-line is the standard operation of awk.

'''One-liner:'''

```AWK
awk '{ print $0 }' filename
```


'''Shorter:'''

Printing the input is the default-action for matching lines,
and "1" evaluates to "True",

so this is the shortest possible awk-program
(not counting the [[Empty program]]):

```AWK
awk '1' filename
```


'''Longer:'''

Reading several files, with some processing:

```AWK
# usage: awk  -f readlines.awk  *.txt
BEGIN  { print "# Reading..." }
FNR==1 { f++; print "# File #" f, ":", FILENAME }
/^#/   { c++; next }               # skip lines starting with "#", but count them
/you/  { gsub("to", "TO") }        # change text in lines with "you" somewhere
/TO/   { print FNR,":",$0; next }  # print with line-number
       { print }                   # same as "print $0"
END    { print "# Done with", f, "file(s), with a total of", NR, "lines." }
END    { print "# Comment-lines:", c }
```

Note:
* The variables c and f are initialized automatically to 0
*  NR is the number of records read so far, for all files read
* FNR is the number of records read from the current file
* There can be multiple BEGIN and END-blocks
{{in}}

```txt

# This is the file input.txt
you can use it
to provide input
to your program to do
some processing.

```

{{out}}

```txt

# Reading...
# File #1 : input.txt

## ZX Spectrum Basic
=
The tape recorder interface does not support fragmented reads, because tape recorder start and stop is not atomic, (and a leadin is required for tape input).
However, the microdrive does support fragmented reads.
In the following example, we read a file line by line from a file on microdrive 1.


```basic
10 REM open my file for input
20 OPEN #4;"m";1;"MYFILE": REM stream 4 is the first available for general purpose
30 INPUT #4; LINE a$: REM a$ will hold our line from the file
40 REM because we do not know how many lines are in the file, we need an error trap
50 REM to gracefully exit when the file is read. (omitted from this example)
60 REM to prevent an error at end of file, place a handler here
100 GOTO 30
```



## Batch File

This takes account on the blank lines, because FOR ignores blank lines when reading a file.

```dos
@echo off
rem delayed expansion must be disabled before the FOR command.
setlocal disabledelayedexpansion
for /f "tokens=1* delims=]" %%A in ('type "File.txt"^|find /v /n ""') do (
	set var=%%B
	setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
		echo(!var!
	endlocal
)
```



## BBC BASIC

{{works with|BBC BASIC for Windows}}
This method is appropriate if the lines are terminated by a single CR or LF:

```bbcbasic
      file% = OPENIN("*.txt")
      IF file%=0 ERROR 100, "File could not be opened"
      WHILE NOT EOF#file%
        a$ = GET$#file%
      ENDWHILE
      CLOSE #file%
```

This method is appropriate if the lines are terminated by a CRLF pair:

```bbcbasic
      file% = OPENIN("*.txt")
      IF file%=0 ERROR 100, "File could not be opened"
      WHILE NOT EOF#file%
        INPUT #file%, a$
        IF ASCa$=10 a$ = MID$(a$,2)
      ENDWHILE
      CLOSE #file%
```



## Bracmat

<code>fil</code> is a relatively low level Bracmat function for manipulating files. Depending on the parameters it opens, closes, reads, writes a file or reads or sets the file position.

```bracmat
  fil$("test.txt",r)    { r opens a text file, rb opens a binary file for reading }
& fil$(,STR,\n)         { first argument empty: same as before (i.e. "test.txt") }
                        { if \n were replaced by e.g. "\n\t " we would read word-wise instead }
& 0:?lineno
&   whl
  ' ( fil$:(?line.?sep) { "sep" contains found stop character, i.e. \n }
    & put$(line (1+!lineno:?lineno) ":" !line \n)
    )
& (fil$(,SET,-1)|);     { Setting file position before start closes file, and fails.
                          Therefore the | }

## Common Lisp


```lisp
(with-open-file (input "file.txt")
   (loop for line = (read-line input nil)
      while line do (format t "~a~%" line)))
```



## D


```d
void main() {
    import std.stdio;

    foreach (line; "read_a_file_line_by_line.d".File.byLine)
        line.writeln;
}
```

The File is managed by reference count, and it gets closed when it gets out of scope or it changes. The 'line' is a char[] (with newline), so if you need a string you have to idup it.

## DCL


```DCL
$ open input input.txt
$ loop:
$  read /end_of_file = done input line
$  goto loop
$ done:
$ close input
```


## Delphi


```Delphi

   procedure ReadFileByLine;
   var
      TextFile: text;
      TextLine: String;
   begin
      Assign(TextFile, 'c:\test.txt');
      Reset(TextFile);
      while not Eof(TextFile) do
         Readln(TextFile, TextLine);
      CloseFile(TextFile);
   end;

```

The example file (above) '''"c:\test.txt"''' is assigned to the text file variable '''"TextFile"''' is opened and any line is read in a loop into the string variable '''"TextLine"'''.


```Delphi

procedure ReadFileByLine;
   var
      TextLines :  TStringList;
      i         :  Integer;
   begin
      TextLines := TStringList.Create;
      TextLines.LoadFromFile('c:\text.txt');
      for i := 0 to TextLines.count -1 do
      ShowMessage(TextLines[i]);
   end;

```


Above uses the powerful utility classs type [http://www.delphibasics.co.uk/RTL.asp?Name=TStringList TStringList]  from Classes Unit

read_a_file_line_by_line:into_list/1 is used by [[Read_a_specific_line_from_a_file]]. If this task is updated keep backwards compatibility, or change [[Read_a_specific_line_from_a_file]], too.

```erlang

## Fortran


### Old Fortran

Usually, one reads a file with some idea what is in the file and some purpose behind reading it. For this task, suppose that the file just contains plain text, and the text is to be listed, line by line, to the end of the file. The remaining question is how long is the longest record? Some systems enable the reading of a record into a variable that is made big enough to hold whatever the record contains, though perhaps only up to some integer limit such as 65535. Fortran 2000 has formalised the provision of character variables whose size is determined when assigned to (as in <code>TEXT = "This"//"That"</code> where character variable TEXT is reallocated memory so as to hold eight characters, as needed for the assignment) but without a F2000 compiler to test, it is not clear that this arrangement will work for READ statements as well.

So one is faced again with the question "How long is a piece of string?" when choosing a predefined size. I have confronted a singularly witless format for supplying electricity data that would write up to an entire year's worth of half-hourly values to one line though it might be used to write just a few day's worth of data also. The header line specified the date and time slot for each column as <code>Country,Island,Node,MEAN Energy,01AUG2010 Daily ENERGY,01AUG2010 01,01AUG2010 02,01AUG2010 03, ''etc.''</code> so all-in-all it was less trouble to specify CHARACTER*246810 for the input record scratchpad so as not to have to struggle with piecemeal input. In this example, change the value of ENUFF.

A common extension after F77 was the "Q" format, which returns the number of characters yet to be read in the input record. In its absence, one would have to just read the input with A format, and if the input record was shorter than ENUFF, then trailing spaces would be appended to ALINE and if ALINE was capacious then this would waste time. Similarly, for output, trailing spaces should be trimmed off, which means that if the input record contained trailing spaces, they would be lost. The scheme here, available via F90 is to use the Q format feature to determine how long the record is, then, request only that many characters to be placed in ALINE, and, write that many characters to the output which will thereby include any supplied trailing spaces. However, there must of course be no attempt to cram any more than ENUFF characters into ALINE, thus the MIN(L,ENUFF) in the READ statement, where the calculation is done on-the-fly. As well, should L be greater than ENUFF this is worth some remark, and in a way that cannot be confused with a listing line, each of which is prefixed by the record number. The default integer size is 32 bit so the numbers could be large but to avoid annoying blank space in the message, I0 format is used. Earlier Fortrans do not allow this, so one might specify I9.

On the other hand, the output device might be less than accommodating when presented with a line longer than it can print: lineprinters typically printed 120, 132 or maybe 144 characters to a line with anything beyond that ignored if it were not a cause for immediate termination. Thus, the WRITE statement could be augmented with <code>ERR = ''label'', END = ''label''</code> in hope of recovery attempts. If output were to a disc file, the END might be activated on running out of disc space but with windows the system would probably have crashed already. Given a long line to print a teletype printer would just hammer away at the last printing position, but more refined printers would start new lines as needed. I have used a dot-matrix printer that with lineprinter paper could be set to print some 360 cramped characters to a line, and have seen photographs of a special accountant's typewriter with a platen about four feet long. Then for spreadsheet users, there arrived a special printing prog, SIDEWAYS.

Peripheral to the task of reading a file line-by-line is the blather about specifying the file name and opening it. The OPEN statement allows for jumping to an ERR label (just as the READ statement has a jump for end-of-file), and carrying an IOSTAT value to specify the nature of the problem (invalid file name form, file access denied, etc.) but this is all very messy and the error codes are not the same across different systems either. I wish these statements were more like functions and returned TRUE/FALSE or a result code that could be tested in an IF-statement directly, as for example in Burroughs Algol where one could write something like <code>While Read(in) Stuff Do ... ;</code> - though a READ statement returned ''true'' for an I/O error, and ''false'' for success, so one defined ''Ican'' to be ''not'' and wrote <code>While Ican Read(in) Stuff Do ... ;</code>

In the absence of such error reception, ugly messages are presented as the prog. is cancelled, and the most common such error is to name a missing file. So, an INQUIRE statement to check first. This too should have an ERR and IOSTAT blather (the file name might be malformed) but enough is enough. The assignment direction for such codes as EXIST and IOSTAT is ''left'' to right rather than the usual right to left (as in FILE = FNAME), but rather than remember this, it is easiest to take advantage of Fortran's (complete) absence of reserved words and define a logical variable EXIST so that the statement is EXIST = EXIST, and the compiler and the programmer can go their own ways.

```Fortran

      INTEGER ENUFF		!A value has to be specified beforehand,.
      PARAMETER (ENUFF = 2468)	!Provide some provenance.
      CHARACTER*(ENUFF) ALINE	!A perfect size?
      CHARACTER*66 FNAME	!What about file name sizes?
      INTEGER LINPR,IN		!I/O unit numbers.
      INTEGER L,N		!A length, and a record counter.
      LOGICAL EXIST		!This can't be asked for in an "OPEN" statement.
      LINPR = 6			!Standard output via this unit number.
      IN = 10			!Some unit number for the input file.
      FNAME = "Read.for"	!Choose a file name.
      INQUIRE (FILE = FNAME, EXIST = EXIST)	!A basic question.
      IF (.NOT.EXIST) THEN		!Absent?
        WRITE (LINPR,1) FNAME		!Alas, name the absentee.
    1   FORMAT ("No sign of file ",A)	!The name might be mistyped.
        STOP "No file, no go."		!Give up.
      END IF				!So much for the most obvious mishap.
      OPEN (IN,FILE = FNAME, STATUS = "OLD", ACTION = "READ")	!For formatted input.

      N = 0		!No records read so far.
   10 READ (IN,11,END = 20) L,ALINE(1:MIN(L,ENUFF))	!Read only the L characters in the record, up to ENUFF.
   11 FORMAT (Q,A)		!Q = "how many characters yet to be read", A = characters with no limit.
      N = N + 1			!A record has been read.
      IF (L.GT.ENUFF) WRITE (LINPR,12) N,L,ENUFF	!Was it longer than ALINE could accommodate?
   12 FORMAT ("Record ",I0," has length ",I0,": my limit is ",I0)	!Yes. Explain.
      WRITE (LINPR,13) N,ALINE(1:MIN(L,ENUFF))	!Print the record, prefixed by the count.
   13 FORMAT (I9,":",A)		!Fixed number size for alignment.
      GO TO 10			!Do it again.

   20 CLOSE (IN)	!All done.
      END	!That's all.

```

With F90 and later it is possible to use an ALLOCATE statement to prepare a variable of a size determined at run time, so that one could for each record use the <code>Q</code> format code (or a new feature of the READ statement) to ascertain the size of the record about to be read, free the storage for the old ALINE and allocate a new sized ALINE, then read that record into ALINE. This avoids worrying about the record overflowing (or underflowing) ALINE, at the cost of hammering at the memory allocation process.

An alternative approach would be to read the file as UNFORMATTED, just reading binary into some convenient scratchpad and then write the content to the output device, which would make what it could of the ASCII world's dithering between CR, CRLF, LFCR and CR as end-of-record markers. However, this would not be reading the file line-by-line.

## Go

;bufio.Scanner
The bufio package provides Scanner, a convenient interface for reading data such as a file of newline-delimited lines of text. Successive calls to the Scan method will step through the 'tokens' of a file, skipping the bytes between the tokens. The specification of a token is defined by a split function of type SplitFunc; the default split function breaks the input into lines with line termination stripped. Split functions are defined in this package for scanning a file into lines, bytes, UTF-8-encoded runes, and space-delimited words. The client may instead provide a custom split function.

Scanning stops unrecoverably at EOF, the first I/O error, or a token too large to fit in the buffer. When a scan stops, the reader may have advanced arbitrarily far past the last token. Programs that need more control over error handling or large tokens, or must run sequential scans on a reader, should use bufio.Reader instead.


```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"
)

func init() {
	log.SetFlags(log.Lshortfile)
}

func main() {
	// Open an input file, exit on error.
	inputFile, err := os.Open("byline.go")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Error opening input file:", err)
	}

	// Closes the file when we leave the scope of the current function,
	// this makes sure we never forget to close the file if the
	// function can exit in multiple places.
	defer inputFile.Close()

	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(inputFile)

	// scanner.Scan() advances to the next token returning false if an error was encountered
	for scanner.Scan() {
		fmt.Println(scanner.Text())
	}

	// When finished scanning if any error other than io.EOF occured
	// it will be returned by scanner.Err().
	if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(scanner.Err())
	}
}

```


;ReadLine
This function allows files to be rapidly scanned for desired data while minimizing memory allocations.  It also handles /r/n line endings and allows unreasonably long lines to be handled as error conditions.

```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "log"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    f, err := os.Open("file") // os.OpenFile has more options if you need them
    if err != nil {           // error checking is good practice
        // error *handling* is good practice.  log.Fatal sends the error
        // message to stderr and exits with a non-zero code.
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // os.File has no special buffering, it makes straight operating system
    // requests.  bufio.Reader does buffering and has several useful methods.
    bf := bufio.NewReader(f)

    // there are a few possible loop termination
    // conditions, so just start with an infinite loop.
    for {
        // reader.ReadLine does a buffered read up to a line terminator,
        // handles either /n or /r/n, and returns just the line without
        // the /r or /r/n.
        line, isPrefix, err := bf.ReadLine()

        // loop termination condition 1:  EOF.
        // this is the normal loop termination condition.
        if err == io.EOF {
            break
        }

        // loop termination condition 2: some other error.
        // Errors happen, so check for them and do something with them.
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }

        // loop termination condition 3: line too long to fit in buffer
        // without multiple reads.  Bufio's default buffer size is 4K.
        // Chances are if you haven't seen a line terminator after 4k
        // you're either reading the wrong file or the file is corrupt.
        if isPrefix {
            log.Fatal("Error: Unexpected long line reading", f.Name())
        }

        // success.  The variable line is now a byte slice based on on
        // bufio's underlying buffer.  This is the minimal churn necessary
        // to let you look at it, but note! the data may be overwritten or
        // otherwise invalidated on the next read.  Look at it and decide
        // if you want to keep it.  If so, copy it or copy the portions
        // you want before iterating in this loop.  Also note, it is a byte
        // slice.  Often you will want to work on the data as a string,
        // and the string type conversion (shown here) allocates a copy of
        // the data.  It would be safe to send, store, reference, or otherwise
        // hold on to this string, then continue iterating in this loop.
        fmt.Println(string(line))
    }
}
```

;ReadString
In comparison, ReadString is a little quick and dirty, but is often good enough.

```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "log"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    f, err := os.Open("file")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    bf := bufio.NewReader(f)
    for {
        switch line, err := bf.ReadString('\n'); err {
        case nil:
            // valid line, echo it.  note that line contains trailing \n.
            fmt.Print(line)
        case io.EOF:
            if line > "" {
                // last line of file missing \n, but still valid
                fmt.Println(line)
            }
            return
        default:
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
    }
}
```

== {{header|Haskell}}==
Thanks to laziness, there's no difference between reading the file all at once and reading it line by line.


```Haskell
main = do
  file <- readFile "linebyline.hs"
  mapM_ putStrLn (lines file)

```


== {{header|Icon}} and {{header|Unicon}} ==
Line oriented I/O is basic.  This program reads lines from "input.txt" into the variable line, but does nothing with it.


```Icon
procedure main()
f := open("input.txt","r") | stop("cannot open file ",fn)
while line := read(f)
close(f)
end
```



## J


J currently discourages this "read just one line" approach.  In addition to the arbitrary character of lines, there are issues of problem size and scope (what happens when you have a billion characters between your newline delimiters?).  Usually, it's easier to just read the entire file, or memory map the file, and when files are so large that that is not practical it's probably better to put the programmer in explicit control of issues like block sizes and exception handling.

This implementation looks for lines separated by ascii character 10.  Lines returned here do not include the line separator character.  Files with no line-separating character at the end are treated as well formed -- if the last character of the file is the line separator that means that you have an empty line at the end of the file.

This implementation does nothing special when dealing with multi-gigabyte lines.  If you encounter an excessively large line and if do not have enough physical memory, your system will experience heavy memory pressure.  If you also do not have enough virtual memory to hold a line you will get an out of memory exception.

    }
}

{{works with|Java|7+}}
In Java 7, the try with resources block handles multiple readers and writers without nested try blocks. The loop in the main method would look like this:

```java5
for (String filename : args) {
    try (FileReader fr = new FileReader(filename);BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr)){
        String line;
        int lineNo = 0;
        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            processLine(++lineNo, line);
        }
    }
    catch (Exception x) {
        x.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

<code>fr</code> and <code>br</code> are automatically closed when the program exits the try block (it also checks for nulls before closing and throws closing exceptions out of the block).

A more under-the-hood method in Java 7 would be to use the <code>Files</code> class (line numbers can be inferred from indices in the returned <code>List</code>):

```java5
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.nio.charset.Charset;
import java.io.IOException;
//...other class code
List<String> lines = null;
try{
    lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(filename), Charset.defaultCharset());
}catch(IOException | SecurityException e){
    //problem with the file
}
```



## JavaScript


```javascript
var fs = require("fs");

var readFile = function(path) {
    return fs.readFileSync(path).toString();
};

console.log(readFile('file.txt'));
```



## jq

When invoked with the -R option, jq will read each line as a JSON string.  For example:

```sh
$ seq 0 5 | jq -R 'tonumber|sin'
0
0.8414709848078965
0.9092974268256817
0.1411200080598672
-0.7568024953079282
-0.9589242746631385
```


To perform any kind of reduction operation while reading the lines one-by-one, one would normally use
`input` or `inputs`.  For example, to compute the maximum of the above sin values:


```sh
$ seq 0 5 | jq -Rn '[inputs | tonumber |sin] | max'
0.9092974268256817
```



## Jsish


```javascript
/* Read by line, in Jsish */
var f = new Channel('read-by-line.jsi');
var line;

while (line = f.gets()) puts(line);
f.close();
```

{{out}}

```txt

f.close();
```

## Kotlin


```scala
// version 1.1.2

import java.io.File

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    File("input.txt").forEachLine { println(it) }

## Lingo

The following code works fine for text files using 'CRLF' or 'CR only' as line end characters, but unfortunately not for the *nix default 'LF only' (note: Lingo's implementation Director does not run on Linux. It was originally created for ancient Mac OS systems, and later also ported to Windows):

```lingo
fp = xtra("fileIO").new()
fp.openFile(_movie.path & "input.txt", 1)
fileSize = fp.getLength()
repeat while TRUE
  str = fp.readLine()
  if str.char[1] = numtochar(10) then delete char 1 of str
  if the last char of str = numtochar(13) then delete the last char of str
  put str
  if fp.getPosition()>=fileSize then exit repeat
end repeat
fp.closeFile()
```



## LiveCode


```LiveCode
command readFileLineByLine
    local tFile, tLines, startRead
    put "/usr/share/dict/words" into tFile
    open file tFile for text read
    put true into startRead
    repeat until it is empty and startRead is false
        put false into startRead
        read from file tFile for 1 line
        add 1 to tLines
    end repeat
    close file tFile
    put tLines
end readFileLineByLine
```



## Logo

There are several words which will return a line of input.
* readline - returns a line as a list of words
* readword - returns a line as a single word, or an empty list if it reached the end of file
* readrawline - returns a line as a single word, with no characters escaped

```logo
while [not eof?] [print readline]
```



## Lua


```lua
filename = "input.txt"
fp = io.open( filename, "r" )

for line in fp:lines() do
    print( line )
end

fp:close()

```


### Simpler version

The following achieves the same result as the example above, including implicitly closing the file at the end of the loop.

```Lua

for line in io.lines("input.txt") do
  print(line)
end

```

=={{header|Objective-C}}==

To read an entire file into a string, you can:

```objc
NSString *path = [NSString stringWithString:@"/usr/share/dict/words"];
NSError *error = nil;
NSString *words = [[NSString alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:path
                                               encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:&error];

```


Use the UTF-8 encoder on ASCII.

Now to get the individual lines, break down the string:


```objc
NSArray* lines = [words componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet:[NSCharacterSet newlineCharacterSet]];
```



## OCaml



```ocaml
let () =
  let ic = open_in "input.txt" in

    while true do
      let line = input_line ic in
      print_endline line
    done
  with End_of_file ->
    close_in ic
```


But if we want to write a functional loading function we should remember that the <code>try/with</code> couple breaks the [[tail recursion]]. So we should externalise it outside of the loop in another function:


```ocaml
let input_line_opt ic =
  try Some (input_line ic)
  with End_of_file -> None

let read_lines ic =
  let rec aux acc =
    match input_line_opt ic with
    | Some line -> aux (line::acc)
    | None -> (List.rev acc)
  in
  aux []

let lines_of_file filename =
  let ic = open_in filename in
  let lines = read_lines ic in
  close_in ic;
  (lines)
```


we use it like this:


```ocaml
let () =
  let lines = lines_of_file "unixdict.txt" in
  List.iter print_endline lines
```

## PARI/GP

GP has an unfortunate limitations that prevents reading files line-by-line, but it's just as well since its file-handling capabilities are poor.  The [http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/TODO?view=markup&revision=12632&root=pari TODO] file lists one desiderata as adding a <code>t_FILE</code>, which if added would presumably have support for this sort of operation.

Thus the usual way of interacting with files in more than the simple way allowed by <code>read</code> is done by PARI with the usual [[#C|C]] commands:

```C
FILE *f = fopen(name, "r");
if (!f) {
	pari_err(openfiler, "input", name);
}
while(fgets(line, MAX_LINELEN, f) != NULL) {
	// ...
}
```



## Pascal


```pascal
(* Read a file line by line *)
   program ReadFileByLine;
   var
      InputFile,OutputFile: File;
      TextLine: String;
   begin
      Assign(InputFile, 'c:\testin.txt');
      Reset(InputFile);
      Assign(InputFile, 'c:\testout.txt');
      Rewrite(InputFile);
      while not Eof(InputFile) do
	  begin
         ReadLn(InputFile, TextLine);
		 (* do someting with TextLine *)
         WriteLn(OutputFile, TextLine)
      end;
      Close(InputFile);
      Close(OutputFile)
   end.
```



## Perl

For the simple case of iterating over the lines of a file you can do:

```perl
open(my $fh, '<', 'foobar.txt')
    || die "Could not open file: $!";
while (<$fh>)
{ # each line is stored in $_, with terminating newline
  # chomp, short for chomp($_), removes the terminating newline
    chomp;
    process($_);
}
close $fh;
```

File encoding can be specified like:

```perl
open(my $fh, '< :encoding(UTF-8)', 'foobar.txt')
    || die "Could not open file: $!";
```

The angle bracket operator <code>< ></code> reads a filehandle line by line. (The angle bracket operator can also be used to open and read from files that match a specific pattern, by putting the pattern in the brackets.)

Without specifying the variable that each line should be put into, it automatically puts it into <code>$_</code>, which is also conveniently the default argument for many Perl functions. If you wanted to use your own variable, you can do something like this:

```perl
open(my $fh, '<', 'foobar.txt')
    || die "Could not open file: $!";
while (my $line = <$fh>)
{
    chomp $line;
    process($line);
}
close $fh;
```


The special use of the angle bracket operator with nothing inside, will read from all files whose names were specified on the command line:

```perl
while (<>) {
    chomp;
    process($_);
}
```


As noted in <code>perlop.pod</code> under "I/O Operators", <code>&lt;&gt;</code> opens with the 2-arg <code>open()</code> and so can read from a piped command.  This can be convenient but is also very much insecure--a user could supply a file with the name like


```Shell
perl myscript.pl 'rm -rf / |'
```


or any other arbitrary command, which will be executed when perl attempts to open a pipe for it. As such, this feature is best reserved for one-liners and is bad practice to use in production code. The same is true for the open(FILEHANDLE, EXPR) form of open as opposed to open(FILEHANDLE, MODE, EXPR). (See <code>perlfunc.pod</code> on the <code>open()</code> function.)

The <code>ARGV::readonly</code> module can defang <code>@ARGV</code> by modifying the names to ensure they are treated only as files by the <code>open()</code>.

The readline function can be used instead of < >:

```perl
open(my $fh, '<', 'foobar.txt') or die "$!";
while (readline $fh)
{ ... }

while (my $line = readline $fh)
{ ... }
close $fh;
```

The readline function is the internal function used to implement < >, but can be used directly and is useful for conveying programmer intent in certain situations.


## Perl 6

The lines method is lazy so the following code does indeed read the file line by line, and not all at once.

```perl6
for open('test.txt').lines
{
  .say
}
```


In order to be more explicit about the file being read on line at a time, one can write:

```perl6
my $f = open 'test.txt';
while my $line = $f.get {
    say $line;
}
```

    DoSomethingWithTheLine(Line)
  Wend
  CloseFile(0)
EndIf
```



## Python

For the simple case of iterating over the lines of a file you can do:

```python
with open("foobar.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        process(line)
```

The with statement ensures the correct closing of the file after it is processed, and iterating over the file object <code>f</code>, adjusts what is considered line separator character(s) so the code will work on multiple operating systems such as Windows, Mac, and Solaris without change.

Any exceptional conditions seen when processing the file will raise an exception. Leaving the while loop because of an exception will also cause the file to be correctly closed on the way.

Python also has the [http://docs.python.org/library/fileinput.html fileinput module]. This can process multiple files parsed from the command line and can be set to modify files 'in-place'.

```python
import fileinput
for line in fileinput.input():
    process(line)

```

```R
conn <- file("notes.txt", "r")

## REXX


### basic version


```REXX
/*REXX program to read and display (with count) a file, one line at a time.*/
parse arg fileID .
say 'Displaying file:' fileID

  do linenumber=1  while lines(fileID)\==0      /* loop construct */
  line=linein(fileID)                           /* read line */
  say 'Line' linenumber':' line                 /* show line number and line */
  end linenumber                                /* end loop and confirm which loop */

say
say 'File' fileID 'has' linenumber-1 'lines.'   /*summary.*/
```



### known name version

Or: the 'known name' short version:

```rexx
file='foobar.txt'
do while lines(file)\==0; say linein(file); end
```



### belt and suspenders

The first   '''linein'''   invocation is used to position the record pointer (current position in the file for reading)

in case the parent (REXX) program has already read (for instance) the first couple of records, and the

beginning of the file needs to be re-established so the reading can start from the beginning of the file.


The   '''lineout'''   BIF closes the file (in most REXX interpreters);   this is done for general housekeeping.

```rexx
/*REXX program   reads  and  displays  (with a count)  a file,  one line at a time.     */
parse arg fID .;      if fID==''  then exit      /*Was no fileID specified?  Then quit. */
say center(' displaying file: ' fID" ", 79, '‚ïê') /*show the name of the file being read.*/
call linein fID, 1, 0                            /*see the comment in the section header*/
say                                              /* [‚Üì]  show a file's contents (lines).*/
     do #=1  while lines(fID)\==0; y=linein(fID) /*loop whilst there are lines in file. */
     say                                         /*show a blank line for peruseability. */
     say 'record#='   #   "  length="  length(y) /*show the record number and the length*/
     say y                                       /*show the content of the line (record)*/
     end   /*#*/
say
say 'file '   fID   " has "   #-1   ' records.'  /*display the record count summary.    */
call lineout  fID                                /*close the input file  (most REXXes). */
                                                 /*stick a fork in it,  we're all done. */
```






### ARexx version


```rexx
/* Also works with Regina if you state OPTIONS AREXX_BIFS ; OPTIONS AREXX_SEMANTICS */
filename='file.txt'
contents=''
IF Open(filehandle,filename,'READ')
THEN DO UNTIL EOF(filehandle)
   line=ReadLn(filehandle)

## Ring


```ring

fp = fopen("C:\Ring\ReadMe.txt","r")
r = ""
while isstring(r)
      r = fgetc(fp)
      if r = char(10) see nl
      else see r ok
end
fclose(fp)

```



## Ruby


```ruby
IO.foreach "foobar.txt" do |line|
  # Do something with line.
  puts line
end
```



```ruby
# File inherits from IO, so File.foreach also works.
File.foreach("foobar.txt") {|line| puts line}
```



```ruby
# IO.foreach and File.foreach can also read a subprocess.
IO.foreach "| grep afs3 /etc/services" do |line|
  puts line
end
```


''Caution!'' IO.foreach and File.foreach take a portname.
To open an arbitrary filename (which might start with "|"),
you must use File.open, then IO#each (or IO#each_line).
The block form of File.open automatically closes the file after running the block.


```ruby
filename = "|strange-name.txt"
File.open(filename) do |file|
  file.each {|line| puts line}
end
```



## Run BASIC


```runbasic
open DefaultDir$ + "\public\filetest.txt" for input as #f

        (display line)
        (newline))
```



## Sed

Through a .sed file:

```sed

or through a one-liner in bash:

```bash

sed p filename

## Seed7


```seed7
$ include "seed7_05.s7i";

const proc: main is func
  local
    var file: aFile is STD_NULL;
    var string: line is "";
  begin
    aFile := open("input.txt", "r");
    while hasNext(aFile) do
      readln(aFile, line);
      writeln("LINE: " <& line);
    end while;
  end func;
```


The function [http://seed7.sourceforge.net/libraries/file.htm#hasNext%28in_file%29 hasNext]
returns TRUE when at least one character can be read successfully.


## Sidef

''FileHandle.each{}'' is lazy, allowing us to do this:

```ruby
File(__FILE__).open_r.each { |line|
    print line
}
```


Same thing explicitly:

```ruby
var fh = File(__FILE__).open_r
while (fh.readline(\var line)) {
    print line
}
```

## SNOBOL4


In SNOBOL4, file I/O is done by associating a file with a variable.
Every subsequent access to the variable provides the next record of the file.
Options to the input() function allow the file to be opened in line mode, fixed-blocksize (raw binary) mode, and with various sharing options.
The input() operation generally fails (in most modern implementations) if the file requested is not found (in earlier implementations, that failure is reported the same way as end-of-file when the first actual read from the file is attempted).
You can specify the file unit number to use (a vestigial remnant of the Fortran I/O package used by original Bell Labs SNOBOL4 implementations... in this case, I'll use file unit 20).
Accessing the variable fails (does not succeed) when the end of file is reached.


```snobol4
        input(.infile,20,"readfrom.txt")      :f(end)
rdloop  output = infile                       :s(rdloop)
end
```



## Sparkling

    }

    fclose(f);
}
```



## SPL

## TorqueScript


Read a file line by line:


```TorqueScript

//Create a file object

%f = new fileObject();

//Open and read a file

%f.openForRead("PATH/PATH.txt");

while(!%f.isEOF())
{
	//Read each line from our file

//Close the file object

%f.close();

//Delete the file object

%f.delete();

```

or:

```tuscript

LOOP line=datei

```



## UNIX Shell

Redirect standard input from a file, and then use '''<code>IFS= read -r line</code>''' to read each line.

: [https://www.mirbsd.org/htman/i386/man1/mksh.htm mksh(1) manual] says, "If '''<code>read</code>''' is run in a loop such as '''<code>while read foo; do ...; done</code>''' then leading whitespace will be removed (IFS) and backslashes processed. You might want to use '''<code>while IFS= read -r foo; do ...; done</code>''' for pristine I/O."

{{works with|Almquist Shell}}


```bash
# This while loop repeats for each line of the file.
# This loop is inside a pipeline; many shells will
# run this loop inside a subshell.
cat input.txt |
while IFS= read -r line ; do
  printf '%s\n' "$line"
done
```


{{works with|Almquist Shell}}


```bash
# This loop runs in the current shell, and can read both
# the old standard input (fd 1) and input.txt (fd 3).
exec 3<input.txt
while IFS= read -r line <&3 ; do
  printf '%s\n' "$line"
done
exec 3>&-
```


{{works with|Bourne Shell}}


```bash
# The old Bourne Shell interprets 'IFS= read' as 'IFS= ; read'.
# It requires extra code to restore the original value of IFS.
exec 3<input.txt
oldifs=$IFS
while IFS= ; read -r line <&3 ; do
  IFS=$oldifs
  printf '%s\n' "$line"
done
IFS=$oldifs
exec 3>&-

## Vedit macro language

On Vedit, you do not actually read file line by line.
File reading and writing is handled by automatic file buffering
while you process the file.

This example reads the source code of this macro,
copies it line by line into a new buffer and adds line numbers.

```vedit
File_Open("line_by_line.vdm")
#10 = Buf_Num                   // edit buffer for input file
#11 = Buf_Free                  // edit buffer for output
#1 = 1                          // line number
while (!At_EOF) {
    Reg_Copy(20,1)              // read one line into text register 20
    Buf_Switch(#11)             // switch to output file
    Num_Ins(#1++, NOCR)         // write line number
    Ins_Text("  ")
    Reg_Ins(20)                 // write the line
    Buf_Switch(#10)             // switch to input file
    Line(1)                     // next line
}
Buf_Close(NOMSG)                // close the input file
Buf_Switch(#11)                 // show the output
```


{{out}}

```txt

    1  File_Open("line_by_line.vdm")
    2  #10 = Buf_Num                   // edit buffer for input file
    3  #11 = Buf_Free                  // edit buffer for output
    4  #1 = 1                          // line number
    5  while (!At_EOF) {
    6      Reg_Copy(20,1)              // read one line into text register 20
    7      Buf_Switch(#11)             // switch to output file
    8      Num_Ins(#1++, NOCR)         // write line number
    9      Ins_Text("  ")
   10      Reg_Ins(20)                 // write the line
   11      Buf_Switch(#10)             // switch to input file
   12      Line(1)                     // next line
   13  }
   14  Buf_Close(NOMSG)                // close the input file
   15  Buf_Switch(#11)                 // show the output

```

```vbnet
Imports System.IO

  ' Loop through the lines of a file.
  ' Function assumes that the file exists.
  Private Sub ReadLines(ByVal FileName As String)

    Dim oReader As New StreamReader(FileName)
    Dim sLine As String = Nothing

    While Not oReader.EndOfStream
      sLine = oReader.ReadLine()
      ' Do something with the line.
    End While

    oReader.Close()

  End Sub
```

## zkl

So many ways, here are a few

```zkl
foreach line in (File("foo.zkl")){print(line)}
```


```zkl
File("foo.zkl").pump(Console.print)
```


```zkl
Utils.zipWith(False,fcn(a,b){"%d: %s".fmt(a,b).print()},
      [0..],File("foo.zkl","r"))
-->
0: var R; n:=GarbageMan.gcCount;
1: ref := GarbageMan.WeakRef(String("the","quick brown fox"));
...
```
