μC++, also called uC++, is a programming language, an extension of [[compatible with::derived from::C++]] designed for concurrent programming. Among other features, it adds coroutines, tasks, and monitors, and extends existing language constructs to integrate with them. Its compiler operates as a source-to-source translator targeting C++.

μC++ supports multi level loop exits, like [[Java]].

In μC++ both termination and resumption exception handling is supported, as well as the ability to raise exceptions among coroutines and tasks.
