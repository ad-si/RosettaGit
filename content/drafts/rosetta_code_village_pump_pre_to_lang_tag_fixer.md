I'm thinking, if we did Code Tag Fixer, why not make a Pre Tag Fixer?
I already did a bot, but i need a hash/dict, like this:

[[Python]]= python

[[C Sharp]] = csharp

[[Java]] = java5

[[Common Lisp]] = lisp


I need this, because just lowercasing and removing spaces isn't very secure.

: I thought about it, but not all instances of <nowiki>
```txt
</nowiki> are code snippets.  Several are just output.  There's also a bunch of examples out there that use leading whitespace for the same effect.  I think these will need to be done by hand. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 23:44, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

: This particular discussion is long dead, I know, but for completeness, I figure I ought to put here a link to [[Rosetta Code:Village Pump/Lang-tag bot|my bot that does this (among other things)]]. â€”[[User:Underscore|Underscore]] ([[User talk:Underscore|Talk]]) 23:05, 17 November 2009 (UTC)
