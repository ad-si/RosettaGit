{{implementation|AutoHotkey}}
The official version of AutoHotkey (AHK). Formerly AutoHotkey_L (AHK_L), it is now simply referred to as "AutoHotkey 1.1".

The original creator of AHK, Chris Mallett, released his last version - version 1.0.48.05 - in mid 2009, having lost interest. Lexikos (also known as Steve Gray) had already begun developing a fork that was at the time named AHK_L. AHK_L quickly became the de-facto official version of AutoHotkey. Much long-desired functionality such as Unicode, COM, arrays/objects and more was implemented; some of which was implemented by fellow community members.

After consultation with the community, AutoHotkey_L became the official branch and now has been renamed to "AutoHotkey" or AHK 1.1 to be specific. Lexikos officially became the AHK maintainer.
