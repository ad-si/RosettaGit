{{stub}}{{implementation|Curry}}

The [http://danae.uni-muenster.de/~lux/curry/ Münster Curry compiler] is a native code compiler for the declarative multi-paradigm language [[Curry]]. 
The Münster Curry compiler is portable to many Unix operating systems with precompiled binaries being available for Linux (x86), Mac OS X, and eventually other Unix variants. It is possible to build and use the Münster Curry compiler on Windows systems using the CygWin and MinGW environments.
