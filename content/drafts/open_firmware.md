{{implementation|Forth}}
'''Open Firmware''' is a bootloader based on ANS Standard Forth. It has both a boot monitor for interactively exploring and debugging hardware, as well as a bytecode interpreter used for running platform independent device drivers.  It is an IEEE standard, with many independent implementations (including OpenBIOS). Open Firmware is used on Sun and IBM workstations, PowerPC Macintosh computers, and the OLPC XO-1.
