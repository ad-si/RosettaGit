{{language|MiniScript}}

MiniScript is a high-level scripting language designed originally for embedding in other software (especially games).  The first implementation was in C#.  In 2019, a C++ implementation was added, and both versions were open-sourced on [https://github.com/JoeStrout/miniscript GitHub].

More information can be found at [https://miniscript.org/ miniscript.org].
