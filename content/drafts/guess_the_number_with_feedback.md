;Task:
Write a game (computer program) that follows the following rules:
::* The computer chooses a number between given set limits.
::* The player is asked for repeated guesses until the the target number is guessed correctly
::* At each guess, the computer responds with whether the guess is:
:::::* higher than the target,
:::::* equal to the target,
:::::* less than the target,   or
:::::* the input was inappropriate.

Welcome to Number Guessing!

I have thought up a number between 1 and 100
which you have to guess. I will give hints as we go.

Try #1, please enter a number between 1 and 100: 50
Try again. The number in mind is greater than 50.
Try #2, please enter a number between 1 and 100: abc
Sorry, input seems invalid

## Groovy

Based on the Java implementation

```groovy

def rand = new Random() // java.util.Random
def range = 1..100 // Range (inclusive)
def number = rand.nextInt(range.size()) + range.from // get a random number in the range

println "The number is in ${range.toString()}" // print the range

def guess
while (guess != number) { // keep running until correct guess
    try {
        print 'Guess the number: '
        guess = System.in.newReader().readLine() as int // read the guess in as int
        switch (guess) { // check the guess against number
            case { it < number }: println 'Your guess is too low'; break
            case { it > number }: println 'Your guess is too high'; break
            default:              println 'Your guess is spot on!'; break
        }
    } catch (NumberFormatException ignored) { // catches all input that is not a number
        println 'Please enter a number!'
    }
}

```

Example:
<lang>
The number is in 1..100
Guess the number: ghfvkghj
Please enter a number!
Guess the number: 50
Your guess is too low
Guess the number: 75
Your guess is too low
Guess the number: 83
Your guess is too low
Guess the number: 90
Your guess is too low
Guess the number: 95
Your guess is too high
Guess the number: 92
Your guess is spot on!

## J


```j
require 'misc'
game=: verb define
  assert. y -: 1 >. <.{.y
  n=: 1 + ?y
  smoutput 'Guess my integer, which is bounded by 1 and ',":y
  whilst. -. x -: n do.
    x=. {. 0 ". prompt 'Guess: '
    if. 0 -: x do. 'Giving up.' return. end.
    smoutput (*x-n){::'You win.';'Too high.';'Too low.'
  end.
)
```


Note: in computational contexts, J programmers typically avoid loops.  However, in contexts which involve progressive input and output and where event handlers are too powerful (too complicated), loops are probably best practice.

Example use:

<lang>   game 100
Guess my integer, which is bounded by 1 and 100
Guess: 64
Too high.
Guess: 32
Too low.
Guess: 48
Too high.
Guess: 40
Too low.
Guess: 44
You win.
```

/* Basic Game Logic */

play_guess_number :-

Guess the number: a.
Invalid input.
Guess the number: 3.
Your guess is too low.
