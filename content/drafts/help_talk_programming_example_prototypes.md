Can someone update this to show the works with template? I don't have permissions on it. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 13:25, 8 March 2008 (MST)

Can someone please change <nowiki><c>...</c> to
```c
...
```
</nowiki
 in the last example? --[[User:Ce|Ce]] 08:45, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
::Done and done. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 14:50, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

Am I the only one who hates using spaces to make it format the code? <nowiki>
```txt
</nowiki> is much better, in my opinion, and much easier to edit (when I fix tags, I have to go through and backspace the code, trying to keep it's original indentation) --[[User:Mbishop|Mbishop]]
:The spaces are good for when you want to show one or two lines. There are still legacy examples that use spaces that usually get converted over when someone edits near them. If you see any long examples (maybe 4 or more lines or so) that are formatted using the space method you can change them to pre tags, but less than that it's probably not worth the effort. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] 18:02, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
