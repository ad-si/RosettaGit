{{task|Prime Numbers}}

;Task:
Write a generator of prime numbers, in order, that will automatically adjust to accommodate the generation of any reasonably high prime.

The routine should demonstrably rely on either:
# Being based on an open-ended counter set to count without upper limit other than system or programming language limits. In this case, explain where this counter is in the code.
# Being based on a limit that is extended automatically. In this case, choose a small limit that ensures the limit will be passed when generating some of the values to be asked for below.
# If other methods of creating an extensible prime generator are used, the algorithm's means of extensibility/lack of limits should be stated.


The routine should be used to:
* Show the first twenty primes.
* Show the primes between 100 and 150.
* Show the ''number'' of primes between 7,700 and 8,000.
* Show the 10,000th prime.

'''Note:''' You may reference code already on this site if it is written to be imported/included, then only the code necessary for import and the performance of this task need be shown. (It is also important to leave a forward link on the referenced tasks entry so that later editors know that the code is used for multiple tasks).

'''Note 2:''' If a languages in-built prime generator is extensible or is guaranteed to generate primes up to a system limit, (2<sup>31</sup> or memory overflow for example), then this may be used as long as an explanation of the limits of the prime generator is also given. (Which may include a link to/excerpt from, language documentation).

;nice site to check results:
Website with vast count of primes. Small ones for the first 10000 and up to 1,000,000,000,000 aka 1E12, divided in subranges : "Each compressed file contains 10 million primes"

* The task is written so it may be useful in solving the task   [[Emirp primes]]   as well as others (depending on its efficiency).






## Ada


The solution is based on an open-ended counter, named "Current" counting up to the limit from the Compiler, namely 2**63-1.

The solution uses the package Miller_Rabin from the [[Miller-Rabin primality test]]. When using the gnat Ada compiler, the largest integer we can deal with is 2**63-1. For anything larger, we could use a big-num package.


```Ada
with Ada.Text_IO, Miller_Rabin;

procedure Prime_Gen is

   type Num is range 0 .. 2**63-1; -- maximum for the gnat Ada compiler

   MR_Iterations: constant Positive := 25;
     -- the probability Pr[Is_Prime(N, MR_Iterations) = Probably_Prime]
     -- is 1 for prime N and < 4**(-MR_Iterations) for composed N

   function Next(P: Num) return Num is
      N: Num := P+1;
      package MR is new Miller_Rabin(Num); use MR;
   begin
      while not (Is_Prime(N, MR_Iterations) = Probably_Prime) loop
	 N := N + 1;
      end loop;
      return N;
   end Next;

   Current: Num;
   Count: Num := 0;

begin
   -- show the first twenty primes
   Ada.Text_IO.Put("First 20 primes:");
   Current := 1;
   for I in 1 .. 20 loop
      Current := Next(Current);
      Ada.Text_IO.Put(Num'Image(Current));
   end loop;
   Ada.Text_IO.New_Line;

   -- show the primes between 100 and 150
   Ada.Text_IO.Put("Primes between 100 and 150:");
   Current := 99;
   loop
      Current := Next(Current);
      exit when Current > 150;
      Ada.Text_IO.Put(Num'Image(Current));
   end loop;
   Ada.Text_IO.New_Line;

   -- count primes between 7700 and 8000
   Ada.Text_IO.Put("Number of primes between 7700 and 8000:");
   Current := 7699;
   loop
      Current := Next(Current);
      exit when Current > 8000;
      Count := Count + 1;
   end loop;
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line(Num'Image(Count));

   Count := 10;
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Print the K_i'th prime, for $K=10**i:");
   begin
      loop
	 Current := 1;
	 for I in 1 .. Count loop
	    Current := Next(Current);
	 end loop;
	 Ada.Text_IO.Put(Num'Image(Count) & "th prime:" &
			Num'Image(Current));
	 Count := Count * 10;
      end loop;
   exception
      when Constraint_Error =>
	 Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line(" can't compute the" & Num'Image(Count) &
				"th prime:");
   end;
end;

## C

(def primes
" The following routine produces a infinite sequence of primes

  only produces values as needed).  The method is from clojure primes.clj library
  which produces primes based upon O'Neill's paper:
  'The Genuine Sieve of Eratosthenes'.

   Produces primes based upon trial division on previously found primes up to
   (sqrt number), and uses 'wheel' to avoid
   testing numbers which are divisors of 2, 3, 5, or 7.

'''Alternate version using deferred execution Co-Inductive Streams and a Wheel'''

The above version is adequate for ranges up to the low millions, so covers the task requirements of primes up to just over a hundred thousands easily.  However, it has a O(n^(3/2)) performance which means that it gets slow quite quickly with range as compared to a true incremental Sieve of Eratosthenes, which has O(n (log n)) performance.  The following code is about the same speed for ranges in the low millions but quickly passes the above code in speed for large ranges to where it only takes 10's of seconds for a range of a hundred million where the above code takes thousands of seconds.  The code is based on the Richard Bird list based Sieve of Eratosthenes mentioned in the O'Neil article but has infinite tree folding added as well as wheel factorization so that it is about the same speed and performance as a Sieve of Eratosthenes based on a priority queue; the code is written here in purely functional form with no mutation, as follows:

Now these functional incremental sieves are of limited use if one requires ranges of billions as they are hundreds of times slower than a version of a bit-packed page-segmented mutable array Sieve of Eratosthenes, which for Clojure there is a version at the end of Clojure [[Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Unbounded_Versions]] section on the Sieve of Eratosthenes task page; this version will handle ranges of a billion in seconds rather than hundreds of seconds.

=={{Header|D}}==
This uses a Prime struct defined in the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes#Extensible Version|third entry of the Sieve of Eratosthenes]] task. Prime keeps and extends a dynamic array instance member of uints. The Prime struct has a opCall that returns the n-th prime number. The opCall calls a grow() private method until the dynamic array of primes is long enough to contain the required answer. The function grow() just grows the dynamic array geometrically and performs a normal sieving. On a 64 bit system this program works up to the maximum prime number that can be represented in the 32 bits of an uint. This program is less efficient than the C entry, so it's better to not use it past some tens of millions of primes, but it's enough for more limited usages.

```d
void main() {
    import std.stdio, std.range, std.algorithm, sieve_of_eratosthenes3;

    Prime prime;
    writeln("First twenty primes:\n", 20.iota.map!prime);
    writeln("Primes primes between 100 and 150:\n",
            uint.max.iota.map!prime.until!q{a > 150}.filter!q{a > 99});

This version has a O(n log (log n)) computational complexity due to hash map access being O(1) on average but is somewhat slow due to the constant execution overhead and therefore only somewhat useful for ranges of up to about the tens of millions.

As a bonus, it solves Euler Problem 10 of summing all the primes up to two million quite quickly.

'''A faster alternative version based on the infinite page segmented sieve'''

The unbounded page segmented bit-packed version from the [[Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Unbounded_infinite_iterators.2Fgenerators_of_primes]] at the bottom of the section can do the same job tens of times faster just by substituting 'primesPaged()' for 'primesMap()' in the 'main' function above in all places used.  As noted for the listing on the task page, the code is only limited in range by the integer size limit on 32-bit execution environments, and will be tens of times faster than the above version.  It will otherwise have the same output as above.

It solves the Euler Problem 10 in almost too short a time to be measured, and it becomes useful for ranges of hundreds of thousands.  It can count all the primes to a billion on the low end tablet CPU of an Intel x5-Z8350 at 1.92 Gigahertz used to develop this in 40 seconds but using a generator slows the performance and it can use the provided `countPrimesTo` function to do the job four times as fast by directly manipulating the provided iteration of sieved bit-packed arrays.

The code solves the (trivial) task requirements quickly, but being purely functional, running on a Virtual Machine, and using the multi-precision ("Big Integer") `integer` type is somewhat slower than as implemented in some other languages.

The code is an "infinite" generator as the `integer` type in Elixir is of multi-precision and thus will never run out of range.

As a bonus, the above code solves the Euler Problem 10 of summing the primes to two million in about 7.83 seconds, or about a hundred thousand CPU cycles per prime on a !.92 Gigahertz CPU, which at least is within the 30 second time limit for that problem.

'''Alternate somewhat faster version (over two times)'''

The last code on the Sieve of Eratosthenes Task page uses deferred execution Co-Inductive Streams (CIS's) to implement the incremental functional Sieve of Eratosthenes using an infinite tree folding structure with a final output as a lazy Stream just as for the above.  It is about twice as fast as the above for reasonable ranges of a few millions.  It con be used just by substituting calls to the different named module as in `PrimesSoETreeFolding.primes` rather than `PrimesSoEMap.primes()`.  It has the same limitations as to being "infinite" as the above.

### The Task


```fsharp

Seq.take 20 primes|> Seq.iter (fun n-> printf "%d " n)

```

{{out}}

```txt

2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71

```


```fsharp

```

{{out}}

```txt

30

```

To demonstrate extensibility I find the 10000th prime.

```fsharp

Seq.item 9999 pCache

```

{{out}}

```txt

Real: 00:00:00.185, CPU: 00:00:00.190, GC gen0: 21, gen1: 0
val it : int = 104729

```

I then find the 10001st prime which takes less time.

```fsharp

Seq.item 10000 pCache

```

{{out}}

```txt

Real: 00:00:00.004, CPU: 00:00:00.010, GC gen0: 1, gen1: 0

While the above code does the job for small ranges, it is very slow for more than a few thousands of primes.  Use of the last unbounded mutable array generator from the [[Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Almost_functional_Unbounded]] F# section (last version) on the Sieve of Eratosthenes page is much, much faster as demonstrated below:

```fsharp
printfn "The first 20 primes are:  %s"
  ( primesSeq() |> Seq.take 20
      |> Seq.fold (fun s p -> s + string p + " ") "" )
printfn "The primes from 150 to 150 are:  %s"
  ( primesSeq() |> Seq.skipWhile ((>) (prime 100))
      |> Seq.takeWhile ((>=) (prime 150))
      |> Seq.fold (fun s p -> s + string p + " ") "" )
printfn "The number of primes from 7700 to 8000 are:  %d"
  ( primesSeq() |> Seq.skipWhile ((>) (prime 7700))
      |> Seq.takeWhile ((>=) (prime 8000)) |> Seq.length )
let strt = System.DateTime.Now.Ticks
for i = 1 to 8 do
  let n = pown 10 i // the item index below is zero based!
  printfn "The %dth prime is:  %A" n (primesSeq() |> Seq.item (n - 1))
let timed = (System.DateTime.Now.Ticks - strt) / 10000L
printfn "All of the last took %d milliseconds." timed
```

The primes from 150 to 150 are:  101 103 107 109 113 127 131 137 139 149

```


Note that the last only takes a few seconds to calculate the first hundred million primes where other algorithms can take days!

Even at that, this is slow due to the time to enumerate and there are much faster ways to do this without using enumeration as in manipulating the found prime bit representations directly...


## Fortran


### The Plan

Over the years, the storage of boolean variables has been a steady source of vexation. Few systems offer operation codes that can work on individual bits, so the usual approach is to allocate a convenient storage unit to hold the value. In Fortran, the default size of a LOGICAL variable is the same as that of an INTEGER variable, and these days, that means thirty-two bits to store the state of one. However, with the increasing use of character manipulation rather than just numbers, there is often support in the cpu for single-character access and some later Fortran compilers will recognise LOGICAL*1 and so reserve only eight bits per boolean variable. Even so, any attempt to store a boolean variable in a single bit will for every access require code to isolate that bit from the rest of the storage unit where it resides, and these operation codes will require more storage than would be saved. Similarly with collections of variables: some might best be aligned to word boundaries (and for double-sized variables, perhaps to even word boundaries) so the storage plan may well involve adding "padding" to preserve such alignment. Some languages (such as pl/i) offer a word ALIGNED to ensure this, and others (such as Pascal) offer PACKED for cramming, of use when dealing with records for a disc file and intending to save space. So, ... if there is a large array of boolean variables, and, there are not so many references to those variables, there is still an opportunity.

And indeed, the array shall be large. Some simple investigations show that storing a collection of prime numbers in an array of integers occupies rather more storage than storing a simple bit array spanning the same range of numbers, and given the obvious scheme of storing bits only for odd integers, this advantage is still greater - see the schedule in the source file. One could argue that the array of successive prime numbers could be stored in various space-saving ways, but, so also can the bit array be compressed. For instance, have a span of a "primorial" size such as 2*3*5 and a reference span with those factors marked "off": that removes seven odd numbers from consideration, leaving eight candidates for each surge and so only eight bits are required to state "prime" or not instead of fifteen. With non-binary computers, "bit fiddling" is less convenient but still possible. One must use techniques similar to those needed to work with the year, month, and day parts of an integer such as 20161015 in binary.

So, the plan is to have a long array of bits, and, rather than commit a lot of memory to this, do so in a disc file with random access. To follow the "extensible" aspect, this disc file will ''not'' be initialised to its maximum extent on the first invocation of the routine, instead, it will be extended as provoked by requests for NEXTPRIME and so forth.


### =Initialisation=

When arranging a sieve of Eratosthenes, one of the problems is that one wishes to step along only with steps of prime number size to avoid wasted effort, but, before the sieve process is completed, there is no ready source of known prime numbers. This is especially difficult when instead of one long sieve covering the whole span of interest, the process is to proceed in surges, repeatedly using some limited size span. For this reason, it is often convenient to prepare an initial array of prime numbers knowing for example that Prime(4792) = 46337, and that the square of the next prime exceeds the range of signed 32-bit integers. But such pre-emptive preparation conflicts with the "extensible" notion, and requires special code and storage for the array.

Because Fortran passes parameters by reference (i.e. by address of the original) a trick is possible. The array SCHARS is shared storage to hold a record from the disc file (as a "buffer") and when subroutine GRASPPRIMEBAG is invoked to gain access to its disc file it notes whether it must create the file. If so, the first record is to be written, and the call is PSURGE(SCHARS) to do so within the shared bitpad. PSURGE knows that its first stepper is with <code>F = 3</code> (because even numbers are not being represented) and proceeds with that, adjusting array SCHARS. When it is ready for the next sieve pass, it invokes <code>F = NEXTPRIME(F)</code> to find the next stepper, which will be five, and NEXTPRIME scans the bit array in SCHARS to find it. ''This is the same bitpad that PSURGE is in the process of adjusting.'' To support this startup ploy, GETSREC (invoked by NEXTPRIME) returns at once when SLAST = 0, signifying that there are no records in the work file as yet. Later, if  GETSREC determines that the bit array is to be extended, it invokes PSURGE with its local array BIT8 as the bitpad to be developed then written to disc, leaving the shared SCHAR array as a record buffer for the use of NEXTPRIME when invoked by PSURGE.

====Supporting NextPrime(n)====
Since the bit array has a simple linear relationship to the numbers it is associated with, function <code>NEXTPRIME(n)</code> (and <code>PREVIOUSPRIME(n)</code>) can easily calculate the index to access the appropriate bits; similarly, function <code>ISPRIME(n)</code> need merely check <code>n = NEXTPRIME(n - 1)</code> rather than slog through possibly all potential prime factors up to SQRT(n) - though this does mean that prime numbers up to ''n'' must be available rather than merely up to SQRT(n). [A later adjustment has ISPRIME(n) repeat the code to locate the bit for ''n'' rather than use NEXTPRIME, which has to scan the bit array to the next prime] But there would be no escape from such a slog for function FIRSTFACTOR(n), unless one abandoned the bit array for a FF array and modified the sieve process to record the first factor. Something like <code>Bit(i) = .false.</code> would be replaced by <code>if (FF(i) <= 1) then FF(i) = F</code>  Were the assignment to be made unconditionally (for faster running, perhaps), the array should be renamed to MaximumPrimeFactor. Either way, ISPRIME(n) remains easy, but much more storage than one bit per entry would be required.

If instead of the next prime one desires to find the ''n'' 'th prime number, then there is a difficulty that would not exist if the prime numbers only were stored in an array - but if they were then <code>NEXTPRIME(n)</code> would have difficulty. Of course, if storage is abundant, both forms of storage could be used and each request could be handled via a simple linear index calculation into the appropriate array.

====Supporting Prime(n)====
To find the ''n'''th prime number, obviously one could scan along the bit array from the start, keeping count. This will soon become tedious, so in order to support function <code>PRIME(n)</code>, each record starts with a count of all the primes that have preceded that record's span and so to find the count for a prime fingered in that record, the scan need work only from the start of that record. So the problem reduces to determining which record is the one containing the ''n'' 'th prime. Since the counts are obviously strictly increasing, a binary search would be a possibility as would be an interpolating search and one could even prepare an array containing the counts so that the search could proceed without needing disc accesses - at the cost of additional storage and organisational complexity, perhaps involving Aitken's interpolation formula, except that polynomials do not provide a good fit to the required shape. Fortunately, mathematicians have considered this aspect of prime numbers also, and a rather intimidating formula is available to give an estimate of the value of the ''n'' 'th prime number. Equipped with this, the appropriate record can be read, the count inspected, and a scan started to find the actual ''n'' 'th prime. Function <code>PRIME(n)</code> can be invoked just as array <code>PRIME(n)</code> might be, but with something of a roil of activity in the background.

Preparing the count field involves another trick, because the first record's count field instead holds the count of records in the bit file. Now note that the sieve starts with <code>SORG = 3</code> which means that before the first block there is a count of one prime number. Thus, if function PRIME is accessing the first block, it must know that the count of previous primes is one and not refer to the count field which instead holds the record count. When PSURGE is preparing the next batch of bits (for the second and subsequent records) it accesses the previous record to find the previous count and scans that record to count its primes so as to prepare the previous count for the new record. When the second record is being prepared by PSURGE, the previous record (the first record) has a record count of one, and, this is exactly the desired count of previous primes for the first record. But only at this point, because in moments the first record will be rewritten with a record count of two. For all this to work, <code>SORG = 3</code> must be the case: it is not a parameter but a constant.


### =Integer Overflow=

The variables are all the default thirty-two bit two's complement integers and integer overflow is a possibility, especially because someone is sure to wonder what is the largest prime that can be represented in thirty-two bits - see the output. The code would be extensible in another way, if all appearances of <code>INTEGER</code> were to be replaced by <code>INTEGER*8</code> though not all variables need be changed - such as <code>C</code> and <code>B</code> because they need only index a character in array SCHARS or a bit in a character. Using sixty-four bits for such variables is excessive even if the cpu uses a 64-bit data bus to memory. If such a change were to be made, then all would go well as cpu time and disc space were consumed up to the point when the count of prime numbers can no longer be fitted into the four character storage allowance in the record format. This will be when more than 4,294,967,295 primes have been counted (with 64-bit arithmetic its four bytes will manifest as an unsigned integer) in previous records, and Prime(4,294,967,295) = 104,484,802,043, so that the bit file would require a mere 6,530MB or so - which some may think is not too much. If so, expanding the allowance from four to five characters would be easy enough, and then 256 times as many primes could be counted. That would also expand the reach of the record counter, which otherwise would be limited to 4,294,967,295 records of 4096 bytes each, or a bit bag of 17,592,186,040,320 bytes - only seventeen terabytes...

Overflow is also a problem in many of the calculations. For instance, for a given (prime) number F, the marking of multiples of F via the sieve process starts with the bit corresponding to F² and if this exceeds the number corresponding to the last bit of the current sieve span, then the sieve process is complete for this span because all later values for F will be still further past the end. So, if <code>LST</code> is the number corresponding to the last bit of the current span,
```Fortran
      DO WHILE(F*F <= LST)         !But, F*F might overflow the integer limit so instead,
      DO WHILE(F <= LST/F)                      !Except, LST might also overflow the integer limit, so
      DO WHILE(F <= (IST + 2*(SBITS - 1))/F)    !Which becomes...
      DO WHILE(F <= IST/F + (MOD(IST,F) + 2*(SBITS - 1))/F) !Preserving the remainder from IST/F.
```

Except, <code>IST</code> might overflow the integer limit, in which case function PSURGE declares itself unable to proceed and returns ''false''.

Overflow is detected by the sudden appearance of negative numbers, as is characteristic of two's complement integer arithmetic. This is ''not'' guaranteed to be used on all computers (notably, on a decimal computer such as the IBM1620 and others), and in its absence, the procedure will malfunction. Some systems detect integer overflow via hardware (a special "flag" register, or an interrupt) and there may be facilities for noticing such events. First Fortran (1957) offered special statements such as <code>IF ACCUMULATOR OVERFLOW ''labelon'',''labeloff''</code> (yes, without brackets) and similarly for QUOTIENT OVERFLOW and DIVIDE CHECK but they were abandoned by the modernisers. The only general solution to this problem would be to convert to using multiple-precision (or "bignum") arithmetic, whereupon the code becomes extensible in another way simply by extending as needed the amount of storage allowed for variables.

These methods have been tested by converting <code>INTEGER</code> to <code>INTEGER*2</code> and also by using a record size of sixteen bytes (because UltraEdit, when displaying in binary, shows that many bytes to a line), and it was a real pleasure for once to be able to read the 32-bit count field at the start of each record left-to-right in hexadecimal rather than in the crazed little-endian order that would otherwise have been used.


### The Code

The source code employs the MODULE facility of F90 simply to avoid the tedium of setting up a COMMON storage area and having to declare the type of the functions in every routine that uses them. Otherwise, older style compilers will accept this, except for an occasional array facility (such as <code>BIT8 = CHAR(255)</code>) and the use of the $ format code to allow the next output to tag on to the same line. The rather more fearsome declaration <code>RECURSIVE FUNCTION NEXTPRIME</code> could be avoided if in subroutine PSURGE, the invocation of NEXTPRIME was replaced by in-line code. Similarly with subroutine GETSREC, though forgetting this didn't seem to make any difference. This is just convenience recursion, not structural recursion to some arbitrary depth.

Although recursion is now permissible if one utters the magic word <code>RECURSIVE</code>, this ability usually is not extended to the workings for formatted I/O so that if say a function is invoked in a WRITE statement's list, should that function attempt to use a WRITE statement, the run will be stopped. There can be slight dispensations if different types of WRITE statement are involved (say, formatted for one, and "free"-format for the other) but an ugly message is the likely result. The various functions are thus best invoked via an assignment statement to a scratch variable, which can then be printed. The functions are definitely not "pure" because although they are indeed functions only of their arguments, they all mess with shared storage, can produce error messages (and even a STOP), and can provoke I/O with a disc file, even creating such a file. For this reason, it would be unwise to attempt to invoke them via any sort of parallel processing. Similarly, the disc file is opened with exclusive use because of the possibility of writing to it. There are no facilities in standard Fortran to control the locking and unlocking of records of a disc file as would be needed when adding a new record and updating the record count. This would be needed if separate tasks could be accessing the bit file at the same time, and is prevented by exclusive use. If an interactive system were prepared to respond to requests for ISPRIME(n), ''etc.'' it should open the bit file only for its query then close it before waiting for the next request - which might be many milliseconds away.

The bit array is stored in an array of type CHARACTER*1 since this has been available longer and more widely than INTEGER*1. One hopes that the consequent genuflections to type checking via functions CHAR(i) and ICHAR(c) will not involve an overhead.

Although the structuralist talk up the merit of "structured" constructs in programming, there are often annoying obstacles. With a WHILE-loop one usually has to repeat the "next item" code to "prime" the loop, as in
```Fortran
      P = NEXTPRIME(100)
      DO WHILE (P.LE.150)
        ...stuff...
        P = NEXTPRIME(P)

While this is not a large imposition in this example, if Fortran were to allow assignment within expressions as in Algol, the tedium of code replication and its risks could be avoided.
```algol68
 P:=100; WHILE (P:=NextPrime(P)) <= 150 DO stuff;
```
 If instead of NEXTPRIME the "next item" code was to read a record of a disc file, the repetition needed becomes tiresome. So, an IF-statement, and ... a GO TO...


### The Results

When creating the bit file, everything appears in a blink up to the millionth prime, then a pause until the ten millionth prime, then about a minute to attain the hundred millionth prime. The blinking lights show that there is not much disc I/O in progress (actually, a solid-state unit) while the cpu is running at full speed. There is a further pause from there until overflow is reached. For a subsequent run with the disc file already prepared, all is completed in a blink. Pausing the Great Internet Mersenne Prime crunch (sixfold) increases the speed and I/O rate by about a third. During the file expansion, the rate of I/O slowly decreases at a decreasing rate - this is due to each successive sieve surge requiring more primes to step with, but the primes themselves thin out and being larger, require fewer steps to traverse the span. The effort for each surge is related to the sum of the reciprocals of the primes that will sieved with and this forms an interesting sequence in its own right. For a given surge width, fewer and fewer hits are made within that width by the larger prime numbers. However, 4092 bytes (four are reserved for the count, and on this windows XP system disc space is allocated in blocks of 4k) gives 32736 bits which with odd numbers only, spans 65472. With 32-bit two's complement, sqrt(2,147,483,647) = 46340·95 so even the largest stepper will land at least once within every span, except that only odd multiples are involved so already the hit rate has drifted below one per span and with extension to still larger numbers, the hit rate will fall further. Thus, if instead each pass were to be for the full width of the bit array in the disc file, the I/O system would suffer a thrashing during the multiple passes unless the entire file could be fitted into random-access memory. But such a scheme would not have the "extensible" aspect.

The disc file holding all primes up to the thirty-two bit limit occupies 134,352,896 bytes, or 128MB. Nothing much, these days. Activating 7-zip out of curiosity resulted in compressing the file by a factor of two. As the primes thin out there will be more and more characters with only one bit on (if not none) rather than a fuller selection. However, the existence of prime pairs shows that the bits will never be all lonely forever. For this run, the last record is number 32,801 and 105,097,477 (hex 643A905) primes have gone before.

Would anyone prefer to see that bit array in the little-endian order within bytes?

The thinning out rather suggests an alternative encoding such as by counting the number of "off" bits until the next "on" bit, but this would produce a variable-length packing so that it would no longer be easy to find the bit associated with a given number by something so simple as <code>R = (NN - SORG)/(2*SBITS)</code> as in NEXTPRIME. A more accomplished data compression system might instead offer a reference to a library containing a table of prime numbers, or even store the code for a programme that will generate the data. File Pbag.for is 23,008 bytes long, and of course contains irrelevant commentary and flabby phrases such as "PARAMETER", "INTEGER", "GRASPPRIMEBAG", ''etc''. As is the modern style, the code file is much larger at 548,923 bytes (containing kilobyte sequences of hex CC and of 00), but both are much smaller than the 134,352,896 bytes of file PrimeSieve.bit.


## FreeBASIC

This program uses the Sieve Of Eratosthenes which is not very efficient for large primes but is quick enough for present purposes.

The size of the sieve array (of type Boolean) is calculated as 20 times the number of primes required which is big enough to compute
up to 50 million primes (a sieve size of 1 billion bytes) which takes under 50 seconds on my i3 @ 2.13 GHz. I've limited the
procedure to this but it should certainly be possible to use a much higher figure without running out of memory.

It would also be possible to use a more efficient algorithm to compute the optimal sieve size for smaller numbers of primes but this will suffice for now.

An implementation of "The Genuine Sieve of Eratosthenese" by Melissa E. O'Niell.  This is the paper cited above in the "Faster Alternative Version" of D.  The Go example here though strips away optimizations such as a wheel to show the central idea of storing prime multiples in a queue data structure.

```go

An alternative showing how to use a good and ''very'' fast open source Sieve of Atkin implementation
via [https://godoc.org/github.com/jbarham/primegen.go github.com/jbarham/primegen.go].
Due to how Go's imports work, the bellow can be given directly to "<code>go run</code>" or "<code>go build</code>" and the latest version of the primegen package will be fetched and built if it's not already present on the system.
(This example may not be exactly within the scope of this task, but it's a trivial to use and extremely fast prime generator probably worth considering whenever primes are needed in Go.)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/jbarham/primegen.go"
)

func main() {
	p := primegen.New()

	fmt.Print("First twenty: ")
	for i := 0; i < 20; i++ {
		fmt.Print(p.Next(), " ")
	}
	fmt.Print("\nBetween 100 and 150: ")
	p.SkipTo(100)
	for n := p.Next(); n < 150; n = p.Next() {
		fmt.Print(n, " ")
	}
	p.SkipTo(7700)
	fmt.Println("\nNumber beween 7,700 and 8,000:", p.Count(8000))
	p.Reset()
	for i := 1; i < 1e4; i++ {
		p.Next()
	}
	fmt.Println("10,000th prime:", p.Next())
}

## JavaScript


'''primeGenerator(num, showPrimes)'''
This function takes two arguments:

'''num''' is either an integer as a limit, or an array of two integers to present a range;

'''showPrimes''' is a boolean to indicate whether the result should be a list (if ''true'') or a single number (if ''false'').

Sounds a bit weird, but I hope it will be intelligible by the testing examples below. First the code:


```JavaScript
function primeGenerator(num, showPrimes) {
  var i,
      arr = [];

  function isPrime(num) {
    // try primes <= 16
    if (num <= 16) return (
      num == 2 || num == 3 || num == 5 || num == 7 || num == 11 || num == 13
    );
    // cull multiples of 2, 3, 5 or 7
    if (num % 2 == 0 || num % 3 == 0 || num % 5 == 0 || num % 7 == 0)
      return false;
    // cull square numbers ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9
    for (var i = 10; i * i <= num; i += 10) {

## jq

{{works with|jq|1.4}}

Recent versions of jq include extensive support for unbounded stream
generators, but in this section, we present a solution to the tasks
that should work with any version of jq from 1.4 onwards.  That is,
instead of using an unbounded generator of a stream of primes, the core of the
approach adopted here is a function, "extend_primes", which can be
applied recursively to generate arbitrarily many, or indefinitely
many, primes, as illustrated by the function named "primes" below.

'''Preliminaries:'''

```jq
# Recent versions of jq include the following definition:
# until/2 loops until cond is satisfied,
# and emits the value satisfying the condition:
def until(cond; next):
  def _until:
    if cond then . else (next|_until) end;
  _until;

def count(cond): reduce .[] as $x (0; if $x|cond then .+1 else . end);
```


'''Prime numbers:'''

```jq
# Is the input integer a prime?
# "previous" must be the array of sorted primes greater than 1 up to (.|sqrt)
def is_prime(previous):
  . as $in
  | (previous|length) as $plength
  | [false, 0]   # state: [found, ix]
  | until( .[0] or .[1] >= $plength;
           [ ($in % previous[.[1]]) == 0, .[1] + 1] )
  | .[0] | not ;

# extend_primes expects its input to be an array consisting of
# previously found primes, in order, and extends that array:
def extend_primes:
  if . == null or length == 0 then [2]
  else . as $previous
  | if . == [2] then [2,3]
    else . + [(2 + .[length-1]) | until( is_prime($previous) ; . + 2)]
    end
  end;

# If . is an integer > 0 then produce an array of . primes;
# otherwise emit an unbounded stream of primes:
def primes:
  . as $n
  | if type == "number" and $n > 0 then
      null | until( length == $n; extend_primes )
    else [2] | recurse(extend_primes) | .[length - 1]
    end;

# Primes up to and possibly including n:
def primes_upto(n):
  until( .[length-1] > n; extend_primes )
  | if .[length-1] > n then .[0:length-1] else . end;
```

'''The tasks:'''
The tasks are completed separately here to highlight the fact that by using "extend_primes", each task can be readily completed without generating unnecessarily many primes.

```jq
"First 20 primes:", (20 | primes), "",

"Primes between 100 and 150:",
   (primes_upto(150) | map(select( 100 < .))), "",

"The 10,000th prime is \( 10000 | primes | .[length - 1] )", "",

(( primes_upto(8000) | count( . > 7700) | length) as $length
    | "There are \($length) primes twixt 7700 and 8000.")
```

{{out}}

```sh
$ jq -r -c -n -f Extensible_prime_generator.jq
First 20 primes:
[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71]

Primes between 100 and 150:
[101,103,107,109,113,127,131,137,139,149]

The 10,000th prime is 104729

There are 30 primes twixt 7700 and 8000.
```



## Julia

Julia's Primes package, included in the distribution, is exact up to 2^64 = 18446744073709551616.
After that, Primes can use the BigInt data type, and then may use a probabalistic prime
determination algorithm for such integers of arbitrarily large size. The probabilistic formula is tune-able,
and by default determines primes with Knuth's recommended level for cryptography of an error less than
(0.25)^25 = 8.881784197001252e-16, or 1 in 1125899906842624.

```julia
using Primes

sum = 2
currentprime = 2
for i in 2:100000
    currentprime = nextprime(currentprime + 1)
    sum += currentprime
end
println("The sum of the first 100,000 primes is $sum")

curprime = 1
arr = zeros(Int, 20)
for i in 1:20
    curprime = nextprime(curprime + 1)
    arr[i] = curprime
end
println("The first 20 primes are ", arr)

println("the primes between 100 and 150 are ", primes(100,150))
println("The number of primes between 7,700 and 8,000 is ", length(primes(7700, 8000)))
println("The 10,000th prime is ", prime(10000))
```

{{output}}

```txt

The sum of the first 100,000 primes is 62260698721
The first 20 primes are [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71]
the primes between 100 and 150 are [101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149]
The number of primes between 7,700 and 8,000 is 30
The 10,000th prime is 104729

```


'''Alternative True Generator'''

The above code just uses the "Primes" package as a set of tools to solve the tasks.  The following code creates a very simple generator using `isprime` inside a iterator and then uses that to solve the tasks:

```julia
using Primes: isprime

PrimesGen() = Iterators.filter(isprime, Iterators.countfrom(Int64(2)))

print("Sum of first 100,000 primes:  ")
println(Iterators.sum(Iterators.take(PrimesGen(), 100000)))
print("First 20 primes:  ( ")
foreach((p->print(p," ")), Iterators.take(PrimesGen(), 20))
println(")")
print("Primes between 100 and 150:  ( ")
for p in Iterators.filter((p->p>=100), PrimesGen()) p > 150 && break; print(p, " ") end
println(")")
let cnt = 0
    for p in PrimesGen()
        p > 8000 && break; if p > 7700 cnt += 1 end
    end; println("Number of primes between 7700 and 8000:  ", cnt)
end
println("The 10,000th prime:  ", Iterators.first(Iterators.drop(PrimesGen(), 9999)))
println()
```


This outputs:
{{output}}

```txt
Sum of first 100,000 primes:  62260698721
First 20 primes:  ( 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 )
Primes between 100 and 150:  ( 101 103 107 109 113 127 131 137 139 149 )
Number of primes between 7700 and 8000:  30
The 10,000th prime:  104729
```


To show it's speed, lets use it to solve the Euler Problem 10 of calculating the sum of the primes to two million as follows:

```julia
using Printf: @printf
@time let sm = 0
          for p in Iterators.filter(isprime, Iterators.countfrom(UInt64(2)))
              p > 2000000 && break
              sm += p
          end; @printf("%d\n", sm) end
```


which outputs:
{{output}}

```txt
142913828922
  0.783845 seconds (328.02 k allocations: 5.042 MiB)
```


As shown, this is of adequate speed for this smallish range; however it wouldn't be adequate to do the same for a range of two billion.

This is an "infinite" iterator whose range is limited by the size of `Int64`, but as it will take about 300 thousand years to get there, it isn't much of a concern.

'''An "infinite" iterator based on a bit-packed page-segmented Sieve of Eratosthenes'''

The above code is more than adequate to solve the trivial tasks as required here, but is really too slow for "industrial strength" tasks for ranges of billions.  The following code uses the Page Segmented Algorithm from [[Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Julia]] to solve the task:

```julia
using Printf: @printf

print("Sum of first 100,000 primes:  ")
println(Iterators.sum(Iterators.take(PrimesPaged(), 100000)))
print("First 20 primes:  ( ")
foreach((p->@printf("%d ", p)), Iterators.take(PrimesPaged(), 20))
println(")")
print("Primes between 100 and 150:  ( ")
for p in Iterators.filter((p->p>=100), PrimesPaged()) p > 150 && break; @printf("%d ", p)) end
println(")")
let cnt = 0
    for p in PrimesPaged()
        p > 8000 && break; if p > 7700 cnt += 1 end
    end; println("Number of primes between 7700 and 8000:  ", cnt)
end
@printf("The 10,000th prime:  %d\n", Iterators.first(Iterators.drop(PrimesPaged(), 9999)))
```


to produce the same output much faster.

To show how much faster it is, doing the same Euler Problem 10 as follows:

```julia
using Printf: @printf
@time let sm = 0
          for p in PrimesPaged()
              p > 2000000 && break
              sm += p
          end; @printf("%d\n", sm) end
```


produces:
{{output}}

```txt
142913828922
  0.016826 seconds (60 allocations: 23.891 KiB)
```


showing it is as over 40 times faster, but it will definitely get even relatively faster with increasing range as this range is relatively trivial for page segmentation and there are more optimizations one can make.

This generator is also "infinite" to the `UInt64` range, but now will "only" take hundreds of years to get there.


## Kotlin

Although we could use the java.math.BigInteger type to generate arbitrarily large primes, there is no need to do so here as the primes to be generated are well within the limits of the 4-byte Int type.
((workwith|Kotlin|version 1.3}}

```scala
fun isPrime(n: Int) : Boolean {
    if (n < 2) return false
    if (n % 2 == 0) return n == 2
    if (n % 3 == 0) return n == 3
    var d : Int = 5
    while (d * d <= n) {
        if (n % d == 0) return false
        d += 2
        if (n % d == 0) return false
        d += 4
    }
    return true
}

fun generatePrimes() = sequence {
        yield(2)
        var p = 3
        while (p <= Int.MAX_VALUE) {
           if (isPrime(p)) yield(p)
           p += 2
        }
    }

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val primes = generatePrimes().take(10000) // generate first 10,000 primes
    println("First 20 primes : ${primes.take(20).toList()}")
    println("Primes between 100 and 150 : ${primes.filter { it in 100..150 }.toList()}")
    println("Number of primes between 7700 and 8000 = ${primes.filter { it in 7700..8000 }.count()}")
    println("10,000th prime = ${primes.last()}")
}
```

'''Alternate with better performance'''

Of all the current submissions on the page, the above code has got to be the worst.  While it is adequate to solve the trivial tasks required by the page, it is a Trial Division Sieve and has O(n^3/2)) asymptotic performance over `n`, the range, where even a purely functional incremental sieve has O(n log n) performance.  There is no need to consider BigInteger at all for a prime generator starting from the lowest to the Long number range, as it will never get there in less than 100's of years.  Even though the above code implements a rudimentary wheel factorization, it will still be extremely slow as that only provides constant factor gains.

The following odds-only incremental Sieve of Eratosthenes generator has O(n log (log n)) performance due to using a (mutable) HashMap:

```scala
fun primesHM(): Sequence<Int> = sequence {
    yield(2)
    fun oddprms(): Sequence<Int> = sequence {
        yield(3); yield(5) // need at least 2 for initialization
        val hm = HashMap<Int,Int>()
        hm.put(9, 6)
        val bps = oddprms().iterator(); bps.next(); bps.next() // skip past 5
        yieldAll(generateSequence(SieveState(7, 5, 25)) {
            ss ->
                var n = ss.n; var q = ss.q
                n += 2
                while ( n >= q || hm.containsKey(n)) {
                    if (n >= q) {
                        val inc = ss.bp shl 1
                        hm.put(n + inc, inc)
                        val bp = bps.next(); ss.bp = bp; q = bp * bp
                    }
                    else {
                        val inc = hm.remove(n)!!
                        var next = n + inc
                        while (hm.containsKey(next)) {
                            next += inc
                        }
                        hm.put(next, inc)
                    }
                    n += 2
                }
                ss.n = n; ss.q = q
                ss
        }.map { it.n })
    }
    yieldAll(oddprms())
}</Lang>

it is faster than the first example even though not using wheel factorization (other than odds-only) and rapidly pulls far ahead of it with increasing range such that it is usable to a range of 100 million in the order of 10 seconds.

'''Alternate with "industrial strength" performance'''

For ranges of a billion and more, one needs a sieve based on Page Segmented mutable arrays.  The last code on the Sieve of Eratosthenes Task page at:  [[Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Unbounded_Versions_2]] can do the job.  When called with the following same `main` as the first example with `primesPaged()` substituted for `generatePrimes()` or `primesHM()`, it produces the same output.

It can count the primes to one billion in about 15 seconds on a slow tablet CPU (Intel x5-Z8350 at 1.92 Gigahertz) with the following code:

```kotlin
primesPaged().takeWhile { it <= 1_000_000_000 }.count()
```


Further speed-ups can be achieved of about a factor of four with maximum wheel factorization and by multi-threading by the factor of the effective number of cores used, but there is little point when most of the execution time as a generator is spend iterating over the results.

In order to take advantage of those optimizations, one needs to write functions that work directly with the provided sequence of culled bit pages such as the provided `countPrimesTo` function does, which counts the primes without the iteration about three times as fast.

## M2000 Interpreter

The fancy way, using two lambda which shares closures (they are pointers, so lanbdas get copies of pointers, which is by value passing, and by reference too). Also I use my loved GOTO. Change 200th to 10000th and wait...
A 5@ is a literal for Decimals (Variables are Variant types, but when they get a value they hold that value type. Array items or in other containers they, get whatever we want, anytime)

Version 2
Now we can make a bigger computation using Fast! mode which eliminate Gui/console refresh to gain speed. We can make a refresh each 50primes, so we have a tiny delay on refreshing if we move a window above M2000 console.

Also I change IsPrime to not add to Inventory Known1, because we want this inventory to have all primes without any missing until the last one.

I provide another IsPrime2 which use PrimeNth to add to Known1.

Inventories are reference type. Lambda functions are value type, but closures which are reference type copied the reference by value, so we get then by reference. Inventories start now with 3 known primes, and PrimeNth works for odd numbers only (see x+=2 before the loop statement)

Loop statement check a flag in a block of code ({ }), so when the block ends restart again (resetting the loop flag)


```M2000 Interpreter

Module CheckPrimes {
      \\ Inventories are lists, Known and Known1 are pointers to Inventories
      Inventory Known=1:=2@,2:=3@,3:=5@
      Inventory Known1=2@, 3@, 5@
      \\ In a lambda all closures are copies
      \\ but Known and Know1 are copies of pointers
      \\ so are closures like by reference
      PrimeNth=lambda  Known, Known1  (n as long) -> {
            if n<1 then Error "Only >=1"
            if exist(known, n) then =eval(known) : exit
            if n>5 then {

### Code Optimization


We can drop ok variable from PrimeNth, using a second label. Statement Restart, restart the block. Labels are hashed when first time used.

I use same indentation so you can copy it at same position as in example above. A loop statement mark once the current block for restart after then last statement on block.


```M2000 Interpreter

PrimeNth=lambda  Known, Known1  (n as long) -> {
      if n<1 then Error "Only >=1"
      if exist(known, n) then =eval(known) : exit
      if n>5 then {
           i=len(known1)
           x=eval(known1, i-1)+2
      } else  x=5 : i=2
      {
            if i=n then  =known(n) : exit
            if  frac(x) then 999
            if frac(x/2) else 999
            if frac(x/3) else 999
            x1=sqrt(x) : d=5@
            {if frac(x/d ) else 999
                  d += 2: if d>x1 then  1000
                  if frac(x/d) else 999
                  d += 4: if d<= x1 else 1000
                  loop
             }
 999     x++ : Restart
1000     i++:Append Known, i:=x  : if not exist(Known1, x) then Append Known1, x

=={{header|Mathematica}} / {{header|Wolfram Language}}==
Prime and PrimePi use sparse caching and sieving. For large values, the Lagarias–Miller–Odlyzko algorithm for PrimePi is used, based on asymptotic estimates of the density of primes, and is inverted to give Prime.
PrimeQ first tests for divisibility using small primes, then uses the Miller–Rabin strong pseudoprime test base 2 and base 3, and then uses a Lucas test.

```Mathematica
Prime[Range[20]]
{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71}
Select[Range[100,150], PrimeQ]
{101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149}

## Nim


For such trivial ranges as the task requirements or solving the Euler Problem 10 of summing the primes to two million, a basic generator such as the hash table based version from the [[Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Nim_Unbounded_Versions]] section of the Sieve of Eratosthenes task will suffice, as follows:

```nim
import tables

type PrimeType = int

proc primesHashTable(): iterator(): PrimeType {.closure.} =
  iterator output(): PrimeType {.closure.} =
    # some initial values to avoid race and reduce initializations...
    yield 2.PrimeType; yield 3.PrimeType; yield 5.PrimeType; yield 7.PrimeType
    var h = initTable[PrimeType,PrimeType]()
    var n = 9.PrimeType
    let bps = primesHashTable()
    var bp = bps() # advance past 2
    bp = bps(); var q = bp * bp # to initialize with 3
    while true:
      if n >= q:
        let inc = bp + bp
        h.add(n + inc, inc)
        bp = bps(); q = bp * bp
      elif h.hasKey(n):
        var inc: PrimeType
        discard h.take(n, inc)
        var nxt = n + inc
        while h.hasKey(nxt): nxt += inc # ensure no duplicates
        h.add(nxt, inc)
      else: yield n
      n += 2.PrimeType
  output

var num = 0
stdout.write "The first 20 primes are:  "
var iter = primesHashTable()
for p in iter():
  if num >= 20: break else: stdout.write(p, " "); num += 1
echo ""
stdout.write "The primes between 100 and 150 are:  "
iter = primesHashTable()
for p in iter():
  if p >= 150: break
  if p >= 100: stdout.write(p, " ")
echo ""
num = 0
iter = primesHashTable()
for p in iter():
  if p > 8000: break
  if p >= 7700: num += 1
echo "The number of primes between 7700 and 8000 is:  ", num
num = 1
iter = primesHashTable()
for p in iter():
  if num >= 10000:
    echo "The 10,000th prime is:  ", p
    break
  num += 1
var sum = 0
iter = primesHashTable()
for p in iter():
  if p >= 2_000_000:
    echo "The sum of the primes to two million is:  ", sum
    break
  sum += p
```

The code isn't particularly fast but more than adequate to run this trivial series of tasks and capable for ranges of a few tens of millions.  It is limited by the maximum size of the `int` numeric range, but is too slow to ever reach that in a reasonable time, as in many minutes to even reach the 32-bit integer number range of over two billion let alone to reach the integer limit for 64-bit machines.

'''Alternate much faster Page Segmented Mutable Bit-Packed Seq version'''

The some Sieve of Eratosthenes Nim Unbounded Versions section as above includes a Page Segmented version at the end that can be used the same way for ranges of a billion in only a second (or something approaching a hundred times faster); this can be used for "industrial strength ranges" as in many billions in a reasonable time.  Its limit is just the numeric range used, so for 64-bit prime times is about 2e10 in years.

To use that sieve, just substitute the following in the code:

```nim
for p in primesPaged():
```


wherever the following is in the code:

```nim
for p in iter():
```

and one doesn't need the lines including `iter` just above these lines at all.

As noted in that section, using an extensible generator isn't the best choice for huge ranges as much higher efficiency can be obtained by using functions that deal directly with the composite culled packed-bit array representations directly as the `countPrimesTo` function does.  This makes further improvements to the culling efficiency pointless, as even if one were to reduce the culling speed to zero, it still would take several seconds per range of a billion to enumerate the found primes as a generator.


## PARI/GP


PARI includes a nice prime generator which is quite extensible:

```c
void
showprimes(GEN lower, GEN upper)
{
  forprime_t T;
  if (!forprime_init(&T, a,b)) return;
  while(forprime_next(&T))
  {
    pari_printf("%Ps\n", T.pp);
  }
}
```


Most of these functions are already built into GP:

```parigp
primes(20)
primes([100,150])
#primes([7700,8000]) /* or */
s=0; forprime(p=7700,8000,s++); s
prime(10000)
```

### alternative

The main intention is the use in http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Emirp_primes.
The speed is about 3x times slower than sieve of Atkin.About 13 secs for 10 billion/146 secs for 100 billion in 64-Bit.
But i can hold all primes til 1e11 in 2.5 Gb memory.Test for isEmirp inserted.
32-bit is slow doing 64-Bit math.Using a dynamic array is slow too in NextPrime.

=={{Header|Perl}}==
Two examples of pure Perl extensible generators are shown in the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes#Extensible_sieves]] section.

The [https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::Prime::Util Math::Prime::Util] module provides a highly performant, feature-rich library for generating, testing, and manipulating prime numbers in Perl. It offers full interoperability with Perl's bigint pragma.

Limits with a 64-bit Perl:
* nth_prime takes about 20 seconds to return the 10^14th prime and should be fast for all results up to ~4e17.  It will be impractically slow past that.
* prime_count uses the LMO algorithm and takes about 35 seconds to return the count for primes to 10^16, and should have state of the art speed to 2^64-1.  After that it will use a primality test in the interval so it still useful for large sizes with a small range.
* fast approximations and upper/lower limits are available, which should be fast for any input size including bigints.
* <tt>primes</tt>, <tt>next_prime</tt>, <tt>prev_prime</tt>, <tt>forprimes</tt>, <tt>prime_iterator</tt>, <tt>prime_iterator_object</tt>, and primality tests will work for practically any size input.  The [https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::Prime::Util::GMP Math::Prime::Uti::GMP] module is recommended for large inputs.  With that module, these functions will work quickly for multi-thousand digit numbers.


```perl
use Math::Prime::Util qw(nth_prime prime_count primes);
# Direct solutions.
# primes([start],end) returns an array reference with all primes in the range
# prime_count([start],end) uses sieving or LMO to return fast prime counts
# nth_prime(n) does just that.  It runs quite fast for native size inputs.
say "First 20: ", join(" ", @{primes(nth_prime(20))});
say "Between 100 and 150: ", join(" ", @{primes(100,150)});
say prime_count(7700,8000), " primes between 7700 and 8000";
say "${_}th prime: ", nth_prime($_) for map { 10**$_ } 1..8;
```

{{out}}

```txt
First 20: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71
Between 100 and 150: 101 103 107 109 113 127 131 137 139 149
30 primes between 7700 and 8000
10th prime: 29
100th prime: 541
1000th prime: 7919
10000th prime: 104729
100000th prime: 1299709

10000000th prime: 179424673
100000000th prime: 2038074743
```


There are many other ways, including <tt>prev_prime</tt> / <tt>next_prime</tt>, a simple iterator, an OO style iterator, a tied array, and a Pari-like <tt>forprimes</tt> construct.  For example, the above example using the OO iterator:

```perl
use Math::Prime::Util "prime_iterator_object";
my $it = prime_iterator_object;
say "First 20: ", join(" ", map { $it->iterate() } 1..20);
$it->seek_to_value(100);
print "Between 100 and 150:";
print " ", $it->iterate() while $it->value() <= 150;
print "\n";
$it->seek_to_value(7700);
my $c = 0;
$c++ while $it->iterate() <= 8000;
say "$c primes between 7700 and 8000";
say "${_}th prime: ", $it->ith($_) for map { 10**$_ } 1..8;
```

Or using forprimes and a tied array:

```perl
use Math::Prime::Util qw/forprimes/;
use Math::Prime::Util::PrimeArray;
tie my @primes, 'Math::Prime::Util::PrimeArray';

say "First 20: @primes[0..19]";  # Slice from the tied array
print "Between 100 and 150: ";  forprimes { print " $_"; } 100,150;  print "\n";
# Count with forprimes
my $c = 0;
forprimes { $c++ } 7700,8000;
print "$c primes between 7700 and 8000\n";
# The tied array tries to do the right thing -- sieve a window if it sees
# forward or backward iteration, and nth_prime if it looks like random access.
say "${_}th prime: ", $primes[$_-1] for map { 10**$_ } 1..8;
```


Example showing bigints:

```perl
use bigint;
use Math::Prime::Util qw/forprimes prime_get_config/;
warn "No GMP, expect slow results\n" unless prime_get_config->{gmp};
my $n = 10**200;
forprimes { say $_-$n } $n,$n+1000;
```

## Perl 6

Build a lazy infinite list of primes using the Perl 6 builtin is-prime method. ( A lazy list will not bother to calculate the values until they are actually used. ) That is the first line. If you choose to calculate the entire list, it is fairly certain that you will run out of process / system memory before you finish... (patience too probably) but there aren't really any other constraints. The is-prime builtin uses a Miller-Rabin primality test with 100 iterations, so while it is not 100% absolutely guaranteed that every number it flags as prime actually is, the chances that it is wrong are about 4<sup>-100</sup>. Much less than the chance that a cosmic ray will cause an error in your computers CPU.  Everything after the first line is just display code for the various task requirements.


```perl6
my @primes = lazy gather for 1 .. * { .take if $_.is-prime }

say "The first twenty primes:\n   ", "[{@primes[^20].fmt("%d", ', ')}]";
say "The primes between 100 and 150:\n   ", "[{@primes.&between(100, 150).fmt("%d", ', ')}]";
say "The number of primes between 7,700 and 8,000:\n   ", +@primes.&between(7700, 8000);
say "The 10,000th prime:\n   ", @primes[9999];

sub between (@p, $l, $u) {
    gather for @p { .take if $l < $_ < $u; last if $_ >= $u }
}
```

## Phix

Allows a new (and discard-able) sieve block to extend the list of already known primes. By starting with 1..10 done, we can
then filter properly up to 100, so the next(/first) sieve cannot be larger than 90, then it goes 9900, with
99990000 logically next, but that blew 32-bit limits, besides capping it at 400k gave the best performance.

Unfortunately we lose the p<sup><small>2</small></sup> check because we are not necessarily looking at that,
on the plus side this completely avoids all marking/checking of even numbers.

This could almost certainly be further improved by halving the size of the sieve block.

I investigated the use of so-called "wheels", beguiled by the claim that "a 2-3-5-7 wheel saves 77%", until
I realised the breakdown was 2: 50%, 3: 16%, 5: 7%, 7: 4% - it is unthinkable not to exclude even numbers,
the added complexity (and subscripting) of a 30- or 210- element wheel does not seem worthwhile. While it
would be trivial to unroll a 2-3 wheel, it seems far better just to avoid even numbers altogether (hence,
I believe, this achieves 66 of those 77% savings).
Some further discussion of this can be found on my talk page --[[User:Petelomax|Pete Lomax]] ([[User talk:Petelomax|talk]])

### Python: Croft spiral

The Croft spiral sieve prime generator from the [[Prime_decomposition#Python:_Using_Croft_Spiral_sieve|Prime decomposition]] task is used which contains the line
```python
islice(count(7), 0, None, 2)
```

The call to <code>count(7)</code> is to a generator of integers that counts from 7 upwards with no upper limit set.

The definition <code>croft</code> is a generator of primes and is used to generate as many primes as are asked for, in order.


```python
from __future__ import print_function
from prime_decomposition import primes
from itertools import islice


def p_range(lower_inclusive, upper_exclusive):
    'Primes in the range'
    for p in primes():
        if p >= upper_exclusive: break
        if p >= lower_inclusive: yield p

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('The first twenty primes:\n  ', list(islice(primes(),20)))
    print('The primes between 100 and 150:\n  ', list(p_range(100, 150)))
    print('The ''number'' of primes between 7,700 and 8,000:\n  ', len(list(p_range(7700, 8000))))
    print('The 10,000th prime:\n  ', next(islice(primes(),10000-1, 10000)))

===Python: 210-wheel postponed incremental sieve===
With more contemporary itertools use, 210-wheel incremental sieve with postponed primes processing and thus with radically reduced memory footprint which increases slower than  square root of the number of primes produced:

## Racket

Personal note: unless I need the raw power of an application-specific primes generator/filter,
I pretty well stick with the <code>math/number-theory</code> library. And even when I write an ASPG/F I question
how it performs against the <code>math/number-theory</code> version!

## REXX

Programming note:   Most REXXes (of the 32-bit variety) run with an upper limit of roughly 2 Gbytes (for virtual storage), and that is the limit of this program (in building the stemmed array of prime numbers and prime number indicators, and available virtual storage will be the limiting factor of how many primes can be generated.

The method of extending primes (via the PRIMES subroutine) is of two kinds when invoking the PRIMES subroutine:
:* a positive number which will (possibly) generate primes up to that total amount, and
:* a negative number which will (possibly) generate primes up to   |number|.

Two arrays are available to the caller after invoking the PRIMES subroutine.   @.Nth   where this is the Nth prime.   Also, one can check if 1331 is a prime: !.1331 has the value of 1 (is prime), 0 (isn't prime).

For faster speed, the PRIMES subroutine's logic could be optimized a bit, as well as extending the initial list of low primes,   and extending the fixed divisions to reduce the inner   DO K   loop (divisions of 3───►19).

```rexx
/*REXX program calculates and displays primes using an extendible prime number generator*/
parse arg f .;    if f==''  then f=20            /*allow specifying number for  1 ──► F.*/

## Ruby

The prime library behaves like an enumerator. It has an "each" method, which takes an upper bound as argument. This argument is nil by default, which means no upper bound.

```ruby
require "prime"

puts Prime.take(20).join(", ")
puts Prime.each(150).drop_while{|pr| pr < 100}.join(", ")
puts Prime.each(8000).drop_while{|pr| pr < 7700}.count
puts Prime.take(10_000).last

The above version is somewhat slow due to the overhead of computing the hash for the dictionary, but useful up to ranges of a few million as in solving the Euler Problem of summing all primes up to two million as shown above.

'''Alternate much faster version using Page Segmentation with bit-packed arrays'''

The Page Segmentation algorithm as per the the last version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes in the same Swift Unbounded section as the above code can use enumeration to do the same thing but is about 50 times faster, taking an almost imperceptible time to solve Euler Problem 10 and can count the primes to a billion (even by enumeration) in a few seconds.  It can be used just by substituting `primesPaged()` for `soeDictOdds()` in the above testing code.

Using GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library, probabilistic primes), this is a direct drop in for the above:
{{libheader|GMP}}

```zkl
var [const] BN=Import.lib("zklBigNum");  // libGMP
bigPrimes:=Walker(fcn(p){ p.nextPrime().copy(); }.fp(BN(1)));
```

For example:

```zkl
bigPrimes.walk(20).println();   // first 20 primes
bigPrimes.pump(Void,'wrap(p){ bigPrimes.n<=0d10_000 and p or Void.Stop }).println();
