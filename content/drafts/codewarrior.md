Metrowerks CodeWarrior[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeWarrior] is a primarily C++ compiler and IDE for microprocessors and microcontrollers developed by Freescale Semiconductor[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freescale_Semiconductor] as commercial software. It had formerly targeted Mac Carbon, Windows, various flavors of Unix, earlier mobile systems and videogame consoles, prior to Freescale's acquisition of Metrowerks[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrowerks].
