|site=http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/}}
[http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ GNU Octave] is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with [[MATLAB]].
