;Task:
Write a program where the program chooses a number between   '''1'''   and   '''10'''.

A player is then prompted to enter a guess.   If the player guesses wrong,   then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct.

When the player has made a successful guess the computer will issue a   "Well guessed!"   message,   and the program exits.

A   [[:Category:Conditional loops|conditional loop]]   may be used to repeat the guessing until the user is correct.

## Bracmat

The value is generated by the <code>clk</code> function, which returns a (probably) non-integral rational number. The <code>den</code> function retrieves the denominators of this number. The rational number, multiplied by its denominator, becomes an natural number.

( ( GuessTheNumber

## Eiffel


```Eiffel

class
	APPLICATION

create
	make

feature {NONE} -- Initialization

	make
		local
			number_to_guess: INTEGER
		do
			number_to_guess := (create {RANDOMIZER}).random_integer_in_range (1 |..| 10)
			from
				print ("Please guess the number!%N")
				io.read_integer
			until
				io.last_integer = number_to_guess
			loop
				print ("Please, guess again!%N")
				io.read_integer
			end
			print ("Well guessed!%N")
		end

end

```

The code above is simplified if we create a RANDOMIZER, which simplifies reuse (e.g. the code in RANDOMIZER does not have to be recreated for each need of a random number).

```Eiffel

class
	RANDOMIZER

inherit
	ANY
		redefine
			default_create
		end

feature {NONE} -- Initialization

	default_create
			-- <Precursor>
		local
			time: TIME
		do
			sequence.do_nothing
		end

feature -- Access

	random_integer_in_range (a_range: INTEGER_INTERVAL): INTEGER
		do
			Result := (sequence.double_i_th (1) * a_range.upper).truncated_to_integer + a_range.lower
		end

feature {NONE} -- Implementation

	sequence: RANDOM

## Java

{{works with|Java|6+}}

```java5
public class Guessing {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws NumberFormatException{
        int n = (int)(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
        System.out.print("Guess the number between 1 and 10: ");
        while(Integer.parseInt(System.console().readLine()) != n){
            System.out.print("Wrong! Guess again: ");
        }
        System.out.println("Well guessed!");

For pre-Java 6, use a <code>Scanner</code> or <code>BufferedReader</code> for input instead of <code>System.console()</code> (see [[Input loop#Java]]).


## JavaScript


```javascript

function guessNumber() {
  // Get a random integer from 1 to 10 inclusive
  var num = Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10);
  var guess;

  while (guess != num) {
    guess = prompt('Guess the number between 1 and 10 inclusive');
  }
  alert('Congratulations!\nThe number was ' + num);
}

guessNumber();
```


Requires a host environment that supports <code>prompt</code> and <code>alert</code> such as a browser.


## jq

{{works with|jq|1.5}}

jq currently does not have a built-in random number generator, so a suitable PRNG for this task is defined below. Once `rand(n)` has been defined, the task can be accomplished as follows:

```jq

{prompt: "Please enter your guess:", random: (1+rand(9)) }
| ( (while( .guess != .random; .guess = (input|tonumber) ) | .prompt),
  "Well done!"
```


'''Invocation'''

With the program as given here in a file named program.jq, a seed must be specified on the command line as illustrated on the following line:

    $ jq -nr -f program.jq --arg seed 17

'''PRNG'''

```jq
# LCG::Microsoft generates 15-bit integers using the same formula
# as rand() from the Microsoft C Runtime.
# Input: [ count, state, random ]
def next_rand_Microsoft:
  .[0] as $count
  | ((214013 * .[1]) + 2531011) % 2147483648 # mod 2^31
  | [$count+1 , ., (. / 65536 | floor) ];

def rand_Microsoft(seed):
  [0,seed]
  | next_rand_Microsoft  # the seed is not so random
  | next_rand_Microsoft | .[2];

# A random integer in [0 ... (n-1)]:
def rand(n): n * (rand_Microsoft($seed|tonumber) / 32768) | trunc;
```



## Jsish

From Javascript entry.

```javascript
function guessNumber() {
    // Get a random integer from 1 to 10 inclusive
    var num = Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10);
    var guess;
    var tries = 0;

    while (guess != num) {
        tries += 1;
        printf('%s', 'Guess the number between 1 and 10 inclusive: ');
        guess = console.input();
    }
    printf('Congratulations!\nThe number was %d   it took %d tries\n', num, tries);
}

```Lasso

	guess
)

// prompt for a number
stdout('Guess a number between 1 and 10: ')

while(not #status) => {
	#guess = null

	// the following bits wait until the terminal gives you back a line of input
	while(not #guess or #guess -> size == 0) => {
		#guess = file_stdin -> readSomeBytes(1024, 1000)
	}
	#guess = integer(#guess)

	if(not (range(#guess, 1, 10) == #guess)) => {
		stdout('Input not of correct type or range. Guess a number between 1 and 10: ')
	else(#guess == #number)
		stdout('Well guessed!')
		#status = true
	else
		stdout('You guessed wrong number. Guess a number between 1 and 10: ')
	}

}

## LOLCODE

There is no native support for random numbers. This solution uses a simple linear congruential generator to simulate them, with the lamentable restriction that the user must first be prompted for a seed.

```LOLCODE
HAI 1.3

VISIBLE "SEED ME, FEMUR! "!
I HAS A seed, GIMMEH seed

HOW IZ I randomizin
    seed R MOD OF SUM OF 1 AN PRODUKT OF 69069 AN seed AN 10
IF U SAY SO

I IZ randomizin MKAY
I HAS A answer ITZ SUM OF seed AN 1
I HAS A guess

IM IN YR guesser
    VISIBLE "WUTS MY NUMBR? "!
    GIMMEH guess, guess IS NOW A NUMBR

    BOTH SAEM guess AN answer, O RLY?
        YA RLY, VISIBLE "U WIN!", GTFO

## Mercury

Mercury does have a 'time' module in its standard library, but it offers an abstract type instead of the seconds-since-the-epoch we want to seed the RNG with.  So this is also an example of how easy it is to call out to C.  (It's just as easy to call out to C#, Java, and Erlang.)  Also, rather than parse the input, this solution prepares the random number to match the typed input.  This isn't a weakness of Mercury, just the author's desire to cheat a bit.

        $Guess = Read-Host "What's the number?"
        }
        While ($Number -ne $Guess)

secretNumber.

ask             = ((userQuery askString: 'Guess the Number: ') asInteger).
reportSuccess   = (userQuery report: 'You got it!').
reportFailure   = (userQuery report: 'Nope. Guess again.').
sayIntroduction = (userQuery report: 'Try to guess my secret number between 1 and 10.').

hasGuessed = ( [ask = secretNumber] onReturn: [|:r| r ifTrue: [reportSuccess] False: [reportFailure]] ).
run  = (sayIntroduction. [hasGuessed] whileFalse)

Simple method:

[(userQuery askString: 'Guess the Number.') asInteger = n] whileFalse: [

## UNIX Shell

{{works with|Bourne Shell}}

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Guess the number
# This simplified program does not check the input is valid

# Use awk(1) to get a random number. If awk(1) not found, exit now.
number=`awk 'BEGIN{print int(rand()*10+1)}'` || exit

echo 'I have thought of a number. Try to guess it!'
echo 'Enter an integer from 1 to 10.'
until read guess; [ "$guess" -eq "$number" ]
do
  echo 'Sorry, the guess was wrong! Try again!'
done
echo 'Well done! You guessed it.'
```


An older version used <code>while [ "$guess" -ne "$number" ]</code>. With [[pdksh]], input like '+' or '4x' would force the test to fail, end that while loop, and act like a correct guess. With <code>until [ "$guess" -eq "$number" ]</code>, input like '+' or '4x' now continues this until loop, and acts like a wrong guess. With Heirloom's Bourne Shell, '+' acts like '0' (always a wrong guess), and '4x' acts like '4' (perhaps correct).
