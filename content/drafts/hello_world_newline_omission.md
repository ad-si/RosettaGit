{{task|Basic language learning}}

Some languages automatically insert a newline after outputting a string, unless measures are taken to prevent its output.


;Task:
Display the string   <big><big><code>Goodbye, World!</code></big></big>   without a trailing newline.


;Related tasks:
*   [[Hello world/Graphical]]
*   [[Hello world/Line Printer]]
*   [[Hello world/Standard error]]
*   [[Hello world/Text]]





## ACL2


```lisp
(cw "Goodbye, World!")
```



## Ada

This example will implicitly include a final, implementation defined, terminator (usually a linefeed) if the output is a file (RM A.10.7-8) such as <code>stdout</code> on UNIX systems.

```ada

with Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Goodbye_World is
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put("Goodbye, World!");
end Goodbye_World;

```

Using <code>Ada.Text_IO.Text_Streams</code> instead allows us to control the termination.

```ada

with Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Text_IO.Text_Streams;

procedure Goodbye_World is
    stdout: Ada.Text_IO.File_Type := Ada.Text_IO.Standard_Output;
begin
    String'Write(Ada.Text_IO.Text_Streams.Stream(stdout), "Goodbye World");
end Goodbye_World;

```



## Agena


```agena
io.write( "Goodbye, World!" )
```



## ALGOL 68

This works with Algol68 Genie 2.8.2 and above.  Earlier versions appended a gratuitous newline on unflushed output when the program terminated.

```algol68
BEGIN
   print ("Goodbye, World!")
END
```

## BaCon
=
BaCon supports BASIC PRINT ending with trailing semicolon to prevent a newline and also supports a FORMAT clause that uses ''printf'' specifications and special character escapes (with no \n, there is no newline).

```freebasic
PRINT "Goodbye, World!";
PRINT "Goodbye, World!" FORMAT "%s"
```

40 rem   BASIC will print 'READY' at a new line anyway.
50 rem * So, we just print additional message...

```


==={{header|IS-BASIC}}===
<lang IS-BASIC>10 PRINT "Goodbye, World! ";
```



## Batch File

'''Under normal circumstances, when delayed expansion is disabled'''<br/>
The quoted form guarantees there are no hidden trailing spaces after World!

```dos
<nul set/p"=Goodbye, World!"
<nul set/p=Goodbye, World!
```


'''If delayed expansion is enabled, then the ! must be escaped'''<br/>
Escape once if quoted form, twice if unquoted.

```dos
setlocal enableDelayedExpansion
<nul set/p"=Goodbye, World^!"
<nul set/p=Goodbye, World^^^!
```



## BBC BASIC


```bbcbasic
      REM BBC BASIC accepts the standard trailing semicolon:
      PRINT "Goodbye World!";

      REM One could also output the characters individually:
      GW$ = "Goodbye World!"
      FOR i% = 1 TO LEN(GW$)
        VDU ASCMID$(GW$, i%)
      NEXT
```



## Bc


```Bc
print "Goodbye, World!"
```



## beeswax


```beeswax
_`Goodbye, World!
```


beeswax prints everything without appending a newline character. beeswax has an instruction to explicitely print a newline character: <code>N</code>.


## Befunge

In Befunge, a newline has to be explicitly output when required, so you can just not include one if it's not wanted.


```befunge
"!dlroW ,eybdooG">:#,_@
```



## Bracmat



```bracmat
put$"Goodbye, World!"
```


=={{header|Brainfuck}}==
One option was to copy the code from the regular Hello World version and omit the last period, but one of the nicer things about the language is that no matter how simple your program is, if it's more than a few characters long, it's probably unique. So here's yet another version of Goodbye, World in Brainfuck.

```bf>>+++++[>++++>+>+>++++>>+++<<<+<+<++[>++>+++>+++>++++>+
+[<]>>-]<-]>>
+.>>+..<.--.++>>+.<<+.>>>-.>++.[<]++++[>++++<-]>.>>.+++.------.<-.[>]<+.[-]
[G   oo d  b     y   e    ,                     W  o   r      l  d     !]
```



## C

In C, we do not get a newline unless we embed one:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  (void) printf("Goodbye, World!");    /* No automatic newline */
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```


However ISO C leaves it up to implementations to define whether or not the last line of a text stream requires a new-line. This means that the C can be targetted to environments where this task is impossible to implement, at least with a direct text stream manipulation like this.

## Fortran


```Fortran
program bye
  write (*,'(a)',advance='no') 'Goodbye, World!'
end program bye
```


The "advance" facility was introduced with F90, as was the ability to specify format instructions (the <code>'(A)'</code> part) without a separate FORMAT statement. Earlier, there was a common extension:

```Fortran
      WRITE (6,1) "Goodbye, World!"
    1 FORMAT (A,$)
      END
```

In this, the FORMAT instruction is to accept alphabetic text (the A) from the WRITE statement, followed by the special $ item (of no mnemonic form) which signified that there was not to be any new line action at the end of the output. This sort of thing is useful when writing a prompt to the screen so that the input of the response appears on the same screen line. The text could also have been incorporated into the FORMAT statement, which would be useful if there were many WRITE statements scattered about that were to send forth the same text.

These facilities only became of interest when, instead of card decks and lineprinters, I/O involved a keyboard and screen with both input and output appearing on the same screen. Thus, in earlier Fortran usage, the issue would not arise for output to a lineprinter, because it was already the case: a line written to the lineprinter was ''not'' followed by a end-of-line/start-new-line sort of action by the lineprinter. It stayed put on the line just written. It was the ''following'' output to the lineprinter that would state "advance one" (or two, or, no) lines at the ''start'' of its output. This was the "carriage control character", and a 1 signified "skip to top-of-form" which is to say, start a new page.

In other words, the Fortran approach for output was <carriage control><output text> rather than the <output text><carriage control> sequence, that now has to be suppressed by the "advance = 'no'" facility.

## J

On a linux system, you can use 1!:3 because stdout is a file:

```j
   'Goodbye, World!' 1!:3 <'/proc/self/fd/1'
Goodbye, World!
```

However, J works in environments other than Linux, so...
'''Solution''':<code>prompt</code> from the misc package.
'''Example''':
```j
   load 'general/misc/prompt'
   prompt 'Goodbye, World!'
Goodbye, World!
```

'''Notes''':  J programs are normally run from a REPL, or session manager, which comes in several flavors.  The traditional commandline-based terminal (jconsole), one of several desktop applications (jqt for the current version of J, jgtk and jwd for older but still supported versions), a web-based frontend (jhs), and various mobile apps (J for iOS, Android).

The specific session manager being used changes the context and therefore answer to this task.  For example, when using J from a browser (including mobile browsers) newlines are omitted by default.  Further, J provides strong tools for coalescing results and manipulating them prior to output, so newline elimination would typically happen before output rather than after.

With that said, <code>prompt</code> handles the most common cases (using binary output for jconsole, so no newline is appended; adjusting the REPL prompt in the desktop apps to to elide the newline which is normally included by default, etc).

For truly automated processes, you'd almost always want this kind of functionality (omitting the newline when printing) in a file- or stream-oriented application.  For those cases, the simple <code>text 1!:3 file</code> will append the text to the referenced file verbatim, without inserting any extra newlines.

So, if a J programmer were asked to solve this task, the right approach would be to ask why that is needed, and then craft a solution appropriate to that situation.

## jq

The "-j" command-line option suppresses the newline that would otherwise be printed, e.g. if "$" is the command-line prompt:

```sh
$ jq -n -j '"Goodbye, World!"'
Goodbye, World!$
```

The trailing "$" is the command-line prompt.

Similarly:

```sh
$ echo '"Goodbye, World!"' | jq -j
Goodbye, World!$
```

## LLVM


```llvm
; This is not strictly LLVM, as it uses the C library function "printf".
; LLVM does not provide a way to print values, so the alternative would be

## Logtalk

No action is necessary to avoid an unwanted newline.

```logtalk

## ML/I


### Simple solution

In ML/I, if there isn't a newline in the input, there won't be one in the output; so a simple solution is this (although it's hard to see that there isn't a newline).

```ML/I
Goodbye, World!
```


### More sophisticated solution

To make it clearer, we can define an ML/I ''skip'' to delete itself and an immediately following newline.

```ML/I
MCSKIP " WITH " NL
Goodbye, World!""
```

## N/t/roff


By default, /.ROFF/ replaces single non-consecutive newline characters with spaces, but considers two consecutive newline characters as a paragraph separator and omits 2-newline's worth of spaces.  The former behaviour is the same as in HTML and Rosettacode's Wiki syntax: text on non-consecutive single newlines get wrapped on the same line above it.  In /.ROFF/, this is the default behaviour if and only if the typesetter is processing the input in fill mode (<code>.fi</code>); though, by default, the typesetter processes in this mode anyway!

Because /.ROFF/ is a document formatting language, most text input is expected to be text input which will get output on paper, so there is usually no need to run a special procedure or routine to output text.


```N/t/roff

Goodbye, World!

```



## Nanoquery


```nanoquery
print "Goodbye, world!"

## OCaml


In OCaml, the function <code>[http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Pervasives.html#VALprint_endline print_endline]</code> prints a string followed by a newline character on the standard output and flush the standard output. And the function <code>[http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Pervasives.html#VALprint_string print_string]</code> just prints a string with nothing additional.


```ocaml

## REXX

It should be noted that upon a REXX program completion, any text left pending without a C/R (or newline) is followed by a

blank line so as to not leave the state of the terminal with malformed "text lines" (which can be followed by other text

(lines) from a calling program(s), or the operating system (shell) which is usually some sort of a "prompt" text string.

```rexx
/*REXX pgm displays a   "Goodbye, World!"   without a trailing newline. */

call charout ,'Goodbye, World!'

## TXR

Possible using access to standard output stream via TXR Lisp:

```bash
$ txr -e '(put-string "Goodbye, world!")'
Goodbye, world!$
```



## UNIX Shell

The ''echo'' command is not portable, and <code>echo -n</code> is not guaranteed to prevent a newline from occuring. With the original [[Bourne Shell]], <code>echo -n "Goodbye, World!"</code> prints <code>-n Goodbye, World!</code> with a newline. So use a ''printf'' instead.

{{works with|Bourne Shell}}


```bash
printf "Goodbye, World!"          # This works. There is no newline.
printf %s "-hyphens and % signs"  # Use %s with arbitrary strings.
```


Unfortunately, older systems where you have to rely on vanilla Bourne shell may not have a ''printf'' command, either.  It's possible that there is no command available to complete the task, but only on very old systems.  For the rest, one of these two should work:


```bash
echo -n 'Goodbye, World!'
```

or

```bash
echo 'Goodbye, World!\c'
```


The ''print'' command, from the [[Korn Shell]], would work well, but most shells have no ''print'' command. (With [[pdksh]], ''print'' is slightly faster than ''printf'' because ''print'' runs a built-in command, but ''printf'' forks an external command. With [[ksh93]] and [[zsh]], ''print'' and ''printf'' are both built-in commands.)

{{works with|ksh93}}
{{works with|pdksh}}
{{works with|zsh}}


```bash
print -n "Goodbye, World!"
print -nr -- "-hyphens and \backslashes"
```

## C Shell
=
C Shell does support <code>echo -n</code> and omits the newline.


```csh
echo -n "Goodbye, World!"
echo -n "-hyphens and \backslashes"
```



## Ursa

Ursa doesn't output a newline to an I/O device by default, so simply omitting an endl object at the end of the output stream is all that's needed.

```ursa
out "goodbye world!" console
