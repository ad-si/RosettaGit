'''PowerBASIC for Windows''' (a.k.a. '''PB/Win''') is the [[Windows]] compiler for [[PowerBASIC]]. This is the version that is meant to deal with windows, and there is an add-on (called [http://www.powerbasic.com/products/pbforms PowerBASIC Forms]) that can make this task easier.

It's important to note that there are some fairly major language differences between the [[PB/DOS|DOS]] and Windows versions of PowerBASIC.

==History==

PB/Win was originally named '''PowerBASIC DLL Compiler''' ('''PB/DLL'''), which reflected its original purpose: writing DLLs for Windows, both 16-bit and 32-bit. (Normal applications were supported in a manner similar to other contemporary languages, using resource scripts to draw windows.) With version 7 the name was changed to PB/Win and 16-bit support was dropped.
