Since this algorithm depends on an exact color-key, it would be better to use a lossless format for this image, such as PNG or GIF. --[[User:IanOsgood|IanOsgood]] 16:58, 8 May 2009 (UTC)
: I used jpg to make it smaller... but I believe 13kBytes or 5kBytes are "almost" the same. A PNG version uploaded. '''This one can be deleted now'''. (Anyway, antialiasing of ImageMagick could make a little bit harder to fill it fully with a floodfill without threshold) --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 17:36, 8 May 2009 (UTC)
