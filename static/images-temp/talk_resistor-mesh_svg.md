This is driving me bunkers.  The SVG validates fine, displays in Firefox and Gimp fine, what does MediaWiki not like about it? !@#$!&* softwares. --[[User:Ledrug|Ledrug]] 17:50, 21 August 2011 (UTC)

: This SVG also displays fine in Midori (a WebKit browser). --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 18:01, 21 August 2011 (UTC)

: Do you think it is a browser bug? I got an error "the file is not valid" the first time I tried it. However, it has started working now. I can see the image. [[User:Markhobley|Markhobley]] 18:50, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
