== New solution, how to upload? ==

I have a new solution which shows how to handle both x/0 and 0/0, but I don't know how to upload it. Just like the previous solution, it's in the form of a "snippet", which is a PNG image file which LabVIEW understands as code.  --[[User:Helge|Helge]] ([[User talk:Helge|talk]]) 14:18, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:Image uploads have been disabled for a while now until [[User:Short Circuit|our admin]] has time to upgrade the site's components. I'm not sure if there is anything he can do about it in the meantime. You could try to contact him directly. --[[User:Mwn3d|Mwn3d]] ([[User talk:Mwn3d|talk]]) 16:46, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
::Currently, I don't know how to contact the [[User:Short Circuit|admin]]. His user talk page is protected and has no changes since 2013. It doesn't help that I'm new here. There is an archieved section on LabVIEW in his user talk page. It discusses if *.vi files or imagage files should be used to document the LabVIEW solutions. Snippets are not mentioned. I think snippets are the "right" solution. --[[User:Helge|Helge]] ([[User talk:Helge|talk]]) 08:16, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
:::The email address in the second paragraph of [[User:Short_Circuit#Contact]] works. --[[User:AndiPersti|Andreas Perstinger]] ([[User talk:AndiPersti|talk]]) 12:12, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
