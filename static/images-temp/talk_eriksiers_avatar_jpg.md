Sigh. The problem that [[User:Cferri|Chris Ferri]] mentioned at [[File talk:Matlab-randomDisc-output.png]] is happening here as well: I uploaded a different avatar image... and I got a smaller version of the first image, rather than the new image. (Yes, I tried "refresh"; no difference. I totally feel like a jackass now.) I'm not going to keep resending the new image until the server decides to cooperate.

My guess is something's probably setup incorrectly on the server side of things -- but since I have roughly zero experience with running a wiki, that's just a left field kinda guess. -- [[User:Eriksiers|Erik Siers]] 17:40, 22 September 2010 (UTC)
