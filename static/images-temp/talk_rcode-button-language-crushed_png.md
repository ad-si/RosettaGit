[[File:Rcode-button-language-crushed.png|96px|alt=Language|link=Category:Solutions by Programming Language]] -- example usage. MW doesn't appear to support specification in pts, and didn't pre-scale the image. Need to find or write an extension to handle that. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 01:44, 11 April 2010 (UTC)
