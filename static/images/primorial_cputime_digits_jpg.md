Plot of the cpu time in seconds for the production of the next thousand values of Primorial(n) - thus, time to go from Primorial(1) to Primorial(1000) then to Primorial(2000), etc. against the number of digits in Primorial(n).
During this calculation, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime computation was running on all "six" cpus of an AMD FX6300 running at 3·76GHz. Only for up to Primorial(960000) as there was a sag at the end probably when I went to bed and stopped bothering the system with additional trivia. The fitted line is Time = Digits*5·6738E-6 - ·48526.
