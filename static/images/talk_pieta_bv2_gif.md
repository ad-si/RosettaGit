== This solution is wrong ==

It is impossible to write a one-row program in Piet that terminates. Due to the fact how the next codel to execute is chosen this solution will simply reverse at the right border and then run backwards (with other instructions, of course). To terminate you need at least three codels, which is why my solution is also three codels high. The only reason for that is program termination. â€”[[User:Hypftier|Hypftier]] 15:12, 27 April 2011 (UTC)
