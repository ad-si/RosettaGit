{{Image-rosettacode-internal}}Image button concept for embedding in [[Template:Language]]. This version is 1" @ 300dpi. I'm counting on MediaWiki to be able to pre-scale it down to 1"@96dpi (or 96x96 pixels) for display on screens. Hopefully, it supports image transclusion based on points, in which case we can specify 72pt, and hope the printer-friendly version pulls the full 300x300 image. That's the idea, anyway.
