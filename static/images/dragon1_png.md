{{image-program-output}}[[output of task::Dragon curve]] produced using the "dragon font" into a TeX file without page numbering, with magnification 2, and then converting the dvi file into png by using dvipng (with option -T tight). Another path could be to use the Netpbm's tool pktopbm; but since the char goes partially outside the bounding box, this solution crops too much of the char.
