I believe the 'pop' (or push) animation is wrong, you see, you pop the objects you pushed last, therefore the last object to pop is the one you pushed into first. [[User:Rainb|Rainb]] ([[User talk:Rainb|talk]]) 04:46, 28 August 2013 (UTC)

:In the context of page [[Queue/Definition]] it seems about right. Your definition above is right too. 
:I see the diagram as '''push'''ing coloured bars up from the bottom to the top where they are stacked for retrieval off the top by the '''pop''' operation. In at the bottom - out at the top, and no shuffling in-between guarantees the FIFO action. --[[User:Paddy3118|Paddy3118]] ([[User talk:Paddy3118|talk]]) 07:03, 28 August 2013 (UTC)
:: Shouldn't be push/pop (which are stack operation names) but rather add/remove. â€“[[User:Dkf|Donal Fellows]] ([[User talk:Dkf|talk]]) 10:58, 28 August 2013 (UTC)
