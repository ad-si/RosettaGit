Illustration of how comparing languages side-by-side might look like.

This was based on [[User:Tyrok1|Tyrok]]'s script with a bit of HTML manipulation done afterwards:

* Set the individual items of the ToC to <code>display: inline-block</code>
* Added a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> wrapper around the two language sections that were compared. This was set to <code>width: 49%</code> and the first one was floated left.
* The very last <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with class <code>visualClear</code> was made visible again so that the content didn't flow outside the main borders.
* A checkbox was added above the ToC to enable the comparison mode (which would then trigger the space-saving ToC layout and side-by-side view).
