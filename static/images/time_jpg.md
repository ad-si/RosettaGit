Plot of the cpu time in seconds for the production of the next thousand values of Primorial(n) - thus, time to go from Primorial(1) to Primorial(1000) then to Primorial(2000), etc. During this calculation, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime computation was running on all "six" cpus of an AMD FX6300 running at 3·76GHz. The sag at the end was probably when I went to bed and stopped bothering the system with additional trivia. The fitted line is Time = N*3·784E-5 - 1·1268, the slope lessened by the droop at the end.
