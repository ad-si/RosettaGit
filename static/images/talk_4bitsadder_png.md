As the server currently supports SVG rendering, would someone care to create an alternative to this image that uses SVG? --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 13:53, 15 June 2010 (UTC)
: Sorry my fault, originals are .fig so that they can be converted easily into svg by ImageMagick I suppose. Doing that and after that... reupload svg version? --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 14:28, 15 June 2010 (UTC)
:: Hey, there's no fault here. Whatever works; SVG just makes more sense to me in this context, and SVG support on the server isn't widely known or used yet. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 14:32, 15 June 2010 (UTC)
::: Simply I 've not thought about it, even though my source was a vectorial format! Now I have svg files, they look ok, (ImageMagick failed, I have to update it or the prog it really uses, but Xfig has an export SVG in beta that worked fine however), ... uploading them. --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 14:37, 15 June 2010 (UTC)
::: Have to change the font into something RC has... or leave it a "default" (how is it better?) --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 14:39, 15 June 2010 (UTC)
:::: RC is using the same rendering engine that The Gimp uses, with all the bugs and such that entails. Your best bet is to make sure it renders in The Gimp before you try uploading it. I don't know much about SVG styling, so I couldn't tell you anything regarding fonts and the like. --[[User:Short Circuit|Michael Mol]] 14:43, 15 June 2010 (UTC)
::::: Uff... too hurry, two failures; those svg files have "Times" explicitly, changed into "serif" (thinking it was like css property font-family, a general name for whatever serif font is available) but it was worse. Strangely the small thumbnail below seems ok... I do some check with GIMP then... but the error msg is sospicious, it seems it searches a ttf font file that it think it should be there, while however svg explicity does not call it (I have that file, so if that is the only problem, GIMP shouldn't fail on my system...) --[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 14:49, 15 June 2010 (UTC)
:::::: GIMP on my system has no problems: I am not able to address the problem RC is experiencing creating the preview. Waiting before uploading the svgs. &mdash;[[User:ShinTakezou|ShinTakezou]] 15:04, 15 June 2010 (UTC)
::::::: If all else fails you could convert the text to paths with Inkscape. —[[User:Hypftier|Johannes Rössel]] 18:07, 15 June 2010 (UTC)
