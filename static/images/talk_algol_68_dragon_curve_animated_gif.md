This page no longer kills the server.  Explanation coming soon in the blog. --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 10:52, 20 April 2009 (UTC)

OOPS... sorry about the dragon... Didn't realise it actually crashed rosettacode.
If mediawiki cached the thumb nail, then the problem would only happen once, and
the next page hit would work.  But I don't know mediamiki enough to suggest a
final solution.

A snap shot seems as a reasonable work around.

: Problem is resolved for the time being.  I detailed it all in the blog, and what I'm going to do about it.  Love the animation, though; I'm planning on using it in a promo video for RC.  I've got everything but the transcode and permanent home for the video finished; It was a fun little project. (Permanent home being important for GFDL reasons...) :-D --[[User:Short Circuit|Short Circuit]] 10:24, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
